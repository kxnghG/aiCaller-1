Before discussing investments with clients, you should understand the purpose of investing and about the key features of the different types of securities in relation to your clients\u2019 investment needs and objectives.

WHAT IS INVESTMENT CAPITAL? Capital is wealth in the form of money or assets of an individual, organization, or nation which is available for development or investment. A nation\u2019s wealth is connected to the quantity and quality of its capital. The more capital a country has, the higher its productivity, competitiveness, and incomes are likely to be. A country builds capital by saving. To save means consuming less than total income. The remainder is available for various purposes such as reducing debt or investing in new assets. Being able to convert idle savings into investment capital is critical for the long run prosperity of an economy. By lending money to buy new housing, banks help local infrastructures grow and meet the needs of an expanding population. The same is true when governments borrow money to build hospitals and roads or when corporations issue securities to finance expansion of their operations", "same is true when governments borrow money to build hospitals and roads or when corporations issue securities to finance expansion of their operations. Without access to investment capital, governments and companies are limited by the amount of capital they can access internally. THE FINANCIAL MARKET Providers of capital (lenders) and users of capital (borrowers) participate in the financial market including governments, corporations, and investors. Financial markets serve borrowers and lenders by: \u2022 channeling funds from lenders to borrowers \u2022 facilitating the timing of purchases through borrowing and lending \u2022 providing a mechanism for government policy For example, if a government needs to borrow funds, it issues bonds. Investors purchase the bonds and act as lenders to the government. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 11 \u2022 4 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE Corporations are major users of investment capital. Corporations raise funds for a number of reasons; the main impetus is to fuel expansion. Significant changes to technology and the globalization of markets provide big incentives for corporations to acquire new equipment", "to fuel expansion. Significant changes to technology and the globalization of markets provide big incentives for corporations to acquire new equipment. A company\u2019s retained earnings may not always suffice. Or, a company may see a greater benefit in using financial markets for current needs, saving retained earnings for other uses or for a business downturn. Corporations also participate in the financial market through mergers and acquisitions in order to take over competitors or to access new markets. DEMAND FOR INVESTMENT CAPITAL The demand for investment capital has been growing rapidly in recent years, in part because of the rise of new markets and emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (also known as BRICS). Long periods of low interest rates and high share values meant more and more corporations have gone directly to the markets to finance their projects when retained earnings and/or bank financing have been unavailable or unattractive. HOW COMPANIES RAISE CAPITAL Corporations can raise money in a number of ways", "ned earnings and/or bank financing have been unavailable or unattractive. HOW COMPANIES RAISE CAPITAL Corporations can raise money in a number of ways. They may issue stock to raise capital; however, doing so spreads ownership of the corporation across a wider group\u2014the shareholders. They may also choose to use long-term debt instruments, such as bonds and debentures, to raise capital. Bonds are backed by assets owned by the issuer and, therefore, may be less risky. Debentures are similar to bonds, except that they are generally unsecured. The ownership structure of a corporation is unchanged by debt issues, but issuing debt can be a negative signal about a firm\u2019s financial health. A large debt burden restricts a corporation\u2019s ability to raise more capital in the future. It also increases the risk of default, forcing the company to pay higher interest rates than similar companies with less debt. Corporations therefore strive for a healthy mix of debt and equity securities. Let\u2019s consider an example of an auto parts producer known as CarKing. EXAMPLE Rising demand for its product has motivated CarKing to build a new factory", "t\u2019s consider an example of an auto parts producer known as CarKing. EXAMPLE Rising demand for its product has motivated CarKing to build a new factory. To do so, it must raise at least $15 million to finance the facility. Simply issuing bonds to cover the costs would put current outstanding debt at a very high level compared to revenue. CarKing decides to offer 100,000 new shares at $50 each into the market, for a total of $5 million (disregarding fees). The rest of the project is financed through a 30-year bond issue, with a 7% annual interest paid semi-annually. This scenario should generate enough capital to build the factory and leave the company\u2019s debt burden relative to its shareholders\u2019 equity within acceptable limits in line with its market sector", "to build the factory and leave the company\u2019s debt burden relative to its shareholders\u2019 equity within acceptable limits in line with its market sector. Corporations also issue short-term debt instruments to finance their day-to-day needs: \u2022 commercial paper, which is unsecured short-term debt \u2022 bankers\u2019 acceptances, which is short-term debt guaranteed by a bank FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES Funds can flow from lenders to borrowers in two ways: \u2022 directly \u2022 indirectly LESSON 1 INVESTMENT CAPITAL 1 \u2022 5 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE DIRECT FINANCING In the case of direct financing, a borrower deals directly with the lender. For example, if a person needs to borrow $1,000, he or she might approach friends and family members to find someone with $1,000 to lend. This is not efficient when large amounts are involved. INDIRECT FINANCING In the case of indirect financing, a borrower does not deal directly with the person who has money to lend. Instead, he or she approaches a financial intermediary who acts as a middleman, bringing many borrowers and lenders together. The most common financial intermediaries are banks", "hes a financial intermediary who acts as a middleman, bringing many borrowers and lenders together. The most common financial intermediaries are banks. Banks have a large pool of funds from their many depositors (lenders) that they can make available to borrowers. Other intermediaries include financial institutions such as investment banks, insurance companies, broker-dealers, investment funds and pension funds. Financial intermediaries offer a number of benefits to the average consumer including efficiency, diversity, and economies of scale. Dealers at these types of financial institutions have a range of products and financial instruments to offer prospective clients. TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT s There is a wide variety of investment products which investors can invest in. There are significant differences among investment products in terms of risk, volatility, return, income payments, and complexity. Many of the different types of Investments can play an important role in a well-diversified investment portfolio", "urn, income payments, and complexity. Many of the different types of Investments can play an important role in a well-diversified investment portfolio. However, whether your client should invest in a particular investment product depends on his or her personal circumstances, financial circumstances, investment needs and objectives, investment knowledge, risk profile, and time horizon. FIXED INCOME Fixed income instruments are issued by governments and corporations when they want to borrow money. These debt instruments include: \u2022 money market instruments \u2022 bonds \u2022 debentures Fixed income securities obligate the issuer to pay the investor interest over the term of the investment and the \u201cpar\u201d or \u201cface\u201d value at maturity. MONEY MARKET Money market instruments are short-term debt instruments issued by governments and corporations that mature within one year. All money market instruments are issued at a discount and mature at par value. The difference between the discount value paid at purchase and the par value at maturity represents the instrument\u2019s return, taxed as interest income", "The difference between the discount value paid at purchase and the par value at maturity represents the instrument\u2019s return, taxed as interest income.

EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 11 \u2022 6 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE BONDS AND DEBENTURES Bonds and debentures are debt instruments issued by governments and corporations with a term to maturity that exceeds one year. BONDS Corporate bonds are secured by specific assets that are pledged by the company. Government bonds are issued by the federal government or a province and the bonds are not secured by assets, but solely on the credit-worthiness of the government issuer. DEBENTURES Debentures are debt instruments issued by corporations that are not secured by specific assets. Municipal debentures are debt instruments issued by a municipal government. EQUITIES Equity securities, or simply equities, are shares issued by a corporation to the shareholders of the company. The shares represent ownership in the corporation, also known as share capital", "are shares issued by a corporation to the shareholders of the company. The shares represent ownership in the corporation, also known as share capital. The shareholders of a company own the residual interest in the company, after the prior claims of all creditors (including bond and debenture holders). The share capital of the corporation includes the common and preferred shares issued and outstanding. COMMON SHARES Common shares represent units of ownership in a company and returns are derived from the appreciation or depreciation in the share\u2019s value which is driven by the company\u2019s profitability. There are no contractual obligations for a company to pay dividends to common shareholders, although dividends are often paid on the common shares of highly profitable companies. PREFERRED SHARES Preferred shares are a class of share capital which carries contractual obligations for the company to pay the preferred shareholders a fixed dividend, ahead of common shareholders. Preferred shareholders also rank ahead of the common shareholders in the event of the company\u2019s insolvency and they have the right to receive par value for their preferred shares under such circumstances", "shareholders in the event of the company\u2019s insolvency and they have the right to receive par value for their preferred shares under such circumstances. However, preferred shareholders do not have the opportunity to profit from higher corporate earnings, as do common shares, since the dividend is fixed. RIGHTS AND WARRANTS Rights and warrants offer investors the right to purchase additional shares at a set price within a specified time period. Warrants are issued when the securities are originally brought to market and rights are issued subsequent to the original offer, to existing shareholders. Rights and warrants can be acquired by the existing shareholders, but they can also trade in the secondary market on an uncovered basis. HYBRID SECURITIES Hybrid securities are those which combine the attributes of two or more different financial instruments into a single security, for example a combination of capital and debt. These include traditional convertible debentures and contingent capital securities", "o a single security, for example a combination of capital and debt. These include traditional convertible debentures and contingent capital securities. Contingent capital securities are subordinated securities, such as subordinated debentures or preferred shares, which convert to common shares if a pre-specified trigger event occurs (e.g. financial conditions warrant re-capitalization, insolvency, etc.). LESSON 1 INVESTMENT CAPITAL 1 \u2022 7 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE DERIVATIVES Derivatives are contracts which give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset (e.g. financial instrument, commodity, etc.) and the value of the derivative is \u201cderived\u201d from the value of the underlying asset. Derivatives include options and futures contracts, and a pre-determined price and pre-determined time are established for the holder to exercise their right. Derivatives can trade on listed exchanges or on over-the-counter markets and trading strategies can be used to hedge against price changes or to speculate in the markets. INVESTMENT FUNDS An investment fund issues securities to investors in the same way as corporations that carry on an active business", "te in the markets. INVESTMENT FUNDS An investment fund issues securities to investors in the same way as corporations that carry on an active business. However, unlike active businesses, they do not invest in plant and equipment or working capital. Instead, they invest in a portfolio of securities issued by other issuers. Investment funds can invest in all types of assets including money market instruments, bonds, preferred shares, and common shares. Investment funds are managed by professional fund managers who buy and sell investments for the investment fund portfolio consistent with the objectives of each fund. Investment funds can be either \u201copen-ended\u201d or \u201cclosed-ended\u201d. Under open-ended funds, as more investors purchase the fund, more units are issued. Under closed-ended funds, a fixed number of units are issued. Both open and closed investment funds invest in a portfolio of assets and units in the portfolio are issued to investors by way of prospectus. Investment funds play an important role because they enable smaller investors to invest in a diversified manner in bond and stock markets", "prospectus. Investment funds play an important role because they enable smaller investors to invest in a diversified manner in bond and stock markets. In the absence of investment funds, investing in the capital markets would not be economically practical or even possible for smaller investors. MUTUAL FUNDS Mutual funds are \u201copen-ended\u201d investment funds and they continuously issue and redeem units, so the number of units outstanding varies from day to day. If more units are redeemed than issued, the fund is said to have net redemptions. If more units are issued than redeemed, the fund is said to have net sales. Mutual funds are restricted from using leverage and limits are imposed in relation to the extent that they may use short selling or derivatives in their portfolio. Mutual funds may be organized as trusts or as corporations. Trusts issue units and corporations issue shares. For the sake of convenience, we will use the term \u201cunits\u201d whether the fund is a trust or a corporation. Mutual funds have become increasingly popular", "For the sake of convenience, we will use the term \u201cunits\u201d whether the fund is a trust or a corporation. Mutual funds have become increasingly popular. One reason for their popularity is because mutual funds have consistently outperformed traditional investments such as savings accounts, GICs, and term deposits, over the long term. With the decline of interest rates from the highs of the 1980s, investors have been looking for ways to earn a return that is higher than that of other savings vehicles. As people become more sophisticated in managing their money, and as their expectations increase about how investments should perform, they have turned to mutual funds to satisfy their investment needs. Investors have also become increasingly interested in long-term growth, specifically as it relates to retirement planning. As the general population\u2019s focus on RRSPs has grown, so too has the focus on mutual funds. CLOSED-END FUNDS Closed-end funds are diversified portfolios where a fixed number of shares of the portfolio are issued. Commonly, the shares of closed-end funds trade on a listed exchange in the same manner as listed common shares", "of shares of the portfolio are issued. Commonly, the shares of closed-end funds trade on a listed exchange in the same manner as listed common shares. Unlike mutual funds, closed-end funds have no limits on short selling.

ETFs invest in diversified portfolios, most commonly with the purpose of replicating a stock index or other financial benchmark or market sector. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs can use derivatives and alternative investment strategies to replicate the index that they follow. In the case of inverse, leveraged, and inverse leveraged ETFs, the fund seeks to generate returns opposite (inverse) of the index, returns which exceed the index by a multiple (e.g. 2X or 200%), or both. ETFs use derivatives, alternative investment strategies, and leverage in order to achieve the desired inverse/ leveraged results", "2X or 200%), or both. ETFs use derivatives, alternative investment strategies, and leverage in order to achieve the desired inverse/ leveraged results. Similar to mutual funds, ETFs have become increasingly popular since ETFs, in tandem with the indices they follow, have outperformed the traditional savings vehicles over the longer term. OTHER INVESTMENTS There is a wide variety of investment products available in the financial marketplace. As innovators in the marketplace continue to develop new products tailored to the needs of investors and issuers of capital, new and innovative investment products are continually brought to market. Some of these investment products include structured products which have been introduced more recently including principal protected notes (PPNs). Other traditional investments include cash equivalents such as guaranteed investment certificates (GICs). The universe of available investment products is vast and evolving.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MARKETS Securities and financial instruments are brought to market and traded in the capital market. The capital market brings together corporations, entrepreneurs, governments, and other organizations seeking capital, with investors and lenders that supply capital. Entities seek to raise capital for various reasons including the need for expansion, research and development, or an increase in working capital for the purpose of repaying debt. The capital market is divided into two markets: \u2022 the primary market \u2022 the secondary market The primary market is where securities (like stocks and bonds) are issued or sold to investors for the first time by an issuer, through a public or private offering of securities. After securities are initially sold by an issuer to investors, the securities can then be traded in the secondary market", "ivate offering of securities. After securities are initially sold by an issuer to investors, the securities can then be traded in the secondary market. HOW SECURITIES ARE BROUGHT TO MARKET How securities are issued for the first time in the primary market depends on whether they are sold under a prospectus or under an exemption from the prospectus requirement.

The private market is where the securities of private (exempt) issuers are offered under an exemption from prospectus requirements. Under Canadian securities legislation, if securities are not sold under a prospectus or a prospectus exemption, it is an illegal distribution. THE PUBLIC OFFERING PROCESS When an issuer sells securities in the public market for the first time, it is known as an initial public offering (IPO). THE PROSPECTUS REQUIREMENT A number of regulatory requirements must be observed before an initial issue of securities may be sold in the public market", "THE PROSPECTUS REQUIREMENT A number of regulatory requirements must be observed before an initial issue of securities may be sold in the public market. The process begins with the filing of a preliminary prospectus. Under securities legislation in Canada, issuers must file a prospectus in order to offer their securities for sale in the public market. The prospectus is an offering document which must be filed with the securities regulator in each province/territory where the securities will be sold. A company that distributes securities under a prospectus is called a reporting issuer. Reporting issuers are subject to certain continuous reporting obligations which require that they provide reports to the securities regulators and to existing investors", "are subject to certain continuous reporting obligations which require that they provide reports to the securities regulators and to existing investors. For example, a reporting issuer must provide reports including: \u2022 unaudited quarterly financial reports \u2022 audited annual financial statements \u2022 management\u2019s discussion and analysis \u2022 information circulars in connection with meetings of security holders Reporting issuers must also provide the regulators and existing investors with prompt announcements in connection with any material changes that occur in their business, operations, or capital. THE PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS The preliminary prospectus must carry a bold disclosure in red ink on the cover page which indicates that information in the prospectus is not complete and the securities may not be sold until regulatory approval (i.e. regulatory receipt) has been obtained. Issuers must use the form of prospectus prescribed by the securities regulators. The majority of issuers must use the \u201clong form\u201d prospectus, particularly in the case of IPOs, while different forms of prospectus exist for investment funds, issuers that qualify for short form prospectus, etc", "particularly in the case of IPOs, while different forms of prospectus exist for investment funds, issuers that qualify for short form prospectus, etc. The electronic filing system in Canada for the disclosure documents of public companies and investment funds is the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR). The preliminary prospectus, final prospectus and any material agreements which are summarized in the prospectus (e.g. agency or underwriting agreement) are to be filed on SEDAR. SEDAR is available to the investing public at www.sedar.com. The offering issuer is also required to file press releases announcing the offering and the closing of the offering, and to file certain other documents required by the securities regulators (e.g. documents affecting shareholders\u2019 rights, reports and consents of experts, etc.).

Following their review, the securities commissions may make comments to the offering issuer and the issuer must respond to these comments. When satisfactory responses have been provided to their comments, the securities commissions issue a receipt. Note: A receipt for a preliminary prospectus or a final prospectus does not constitute an endorsement that the securities offered pursuant to it are a good investment. It only means the prospectus has been reviewed for conformity with securities legislation. PASSPORT SYSTEM In Canada, preliminary and final prospectuses are reviewed under the Passport System. The Passport System streamlines the prospectus filing and registration processes in Canada, the continuous disclosure requirements for public issuers, and applications for prospectus exemptions by private (exempt) issuers. The securities commissions in all jurisdictions have joined the Passport System except Ontario", "for prospectus exemptions by private (exempt) issuers. The securities commissions in all jurisdictions have joined the Passport System except Ontario. Under the passport system, the offering issuer deals with only one securities commission, called the principal regulator. In most cases, the principal regulator is the securities commission in the province or territory where the head office of the offering issuer is located. The offering issuer must still file the prospectus in every applicable jurisdiction via SEDAR and pay the filing fees in every jurisdiction. What happens next differs depending upon whether the principal regulator is the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) or not: \u2022 If the principal regulator is the OSC, it will review the prospectus and, if satisfied, issue a receipt which will also trigger a deemed receipt in the other applicable jurisdictions. \u2022 If the principal regulator is not the OSC, the principal regulator will review the prospectus and the OSC will conduct its own review in tandem with the principal regulator using a passport interface mechanism.

If the OSC has concerns that it is not able to resolve, it may opt out of the dual review. \u2022 If the OSC opts out of a review, the offering issuer will need to deal directly with the OSC to address its concerns. \u2022 If the OSC does not opt out, a receipt issued by the principal regulator will also evidence that the OSC has issued a receipt. In either case, a receipt issued by the principal regulator will trigger a deemed receipt in each other passport jurisdiction where the prospectus has been filed. Under this system, offering issuers do not need to negotiate with thirteen securities commissions in Canada. In most cases, they will need to deal only with the principal regulator", "suers do not need to negotiate with thirteen securities commissions in Canada. In most cases, they will need to deal only with the principal regulator. ENTERING INTO AGENCY OR UNDERWRITING AGREEMENTS As part of a public offering, the offering issuer initially enters into an engagement letter with a lead investment dealer that sets out the terms and conditions of the offering including the size, structure, sometimes the price of the security, the selling commission, expense reimbursement, basic termination provisions, an indemnity in favor of the investment dealer, and other matters. When the preliminary prospectus is filed, the issuer and underwriters enter into an agency (or underwriting) agreement which supersedes the engagement letter. The agency or underwriting agreement is encompassed in summary form into the prospectus.

In a prospectus EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 11 \u2022 14 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE offering, a group of investment dealers (or underwriters) combine their efforts to sell securities through what is called an underwriting syndicate.

Generally, no advertising or marketing activities that can be viewed as promoting are permitted prior to the filing of the preliminary prospectus. BOUGHT DEAL UNDERWRITING Under a bought deal underwriting, the underwriters in the syndicate guarantee a specified amount of capital to the reporting issuer. The underwriters agree to purchase a specified number of securities, at a specified price, at a specified time. In essence the underwriters act as principals since they buy the securities from the issuer and then resell them into the market. However, if the underwriters are unable to sell all the allotted securities, the underwriters are still obligated to purchase the securities at the agreed upon price. A bought deal involves significant risks for the underwriters since there is no guarantee that the underwriting syndicate will be able to sell all the allotted securities purchased in the offering. It should be noted that exempt market dealers also engage in bought deals in the private markets", "ll the allotted securities purchased in the offering. It should be noted that exempt market dealers also engage in bought deals in the private markets. MARKETED OFFERING UNDERWRITING Under a marketed offering underwriting, the underwriters act as principals and they buy the securities from the reporting issuer and then resell them into the market. However, unlike a bought deal, the underwriting agreement is not signed until after the preliminary prospectus is filed. Therefore, the number of securities and offering price of the security is not set out in the preliminary prospectus. Once the preliminary prospectus is filed and receipted, the underwriters begin marketing activities in order to assess the market for the securities. After assessing the market for the securities, the number and price of the securities is set.

After a preliminary prospectus has been receipted, but before any new securities come to market, investment dealers contact their clients seeking \u2018expressions of interest\u2019 to get an idea of whether there is a demand or interest for a particular security. LESSON 2 THE PUBLIC CAPITAL MARKETS 1 \u2022 15 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE Underwriters are able to use the preliminary prospectus as a marketing tool to assess the demand for the new issue in the marketplace. They are required to document the names of everyone who receives the preliminary prospectus, so that if amendments are made, the potential investors can be notified and receive an amended prospectus, including the final prospectus. The underwriters are limited in what they can do to sell the securities while the preliminary prospectus is being reviewed by the securities commissions. This is called the waiting period", "they can do to sell the securities while the preliminary prospectus is being reviewed by the securities commissions. This is called the waiting period.

Standard Term Sheet A term sheet provides potential investors with the contact information for the underwriters, a brief description about the issuer and the securities offered, and a legend with cautionary language. Marketing Materials An underwriter can provide certain other marketing materials to a potential investor during the waiting period, subject to strict conditions and disclosure requirements. Marketing materials include any written communication that contains material facts other than the prospectus, a prospectus amendment/notice, or the standard term sheet", "ls include any written communication that contains material facts other than the prospectus, a prospectus amendment/notice, or the standard term sheet. Road Shows A road show is a presentation to potential investors regarding a distribution of securities under a prospectus. SETTING THE SHARE PRICE AND OTHER SECURITY FEATURES Underwriters advise issuers on the price of the security being offered, the rate of interest and term to maturity (in the case of fixed income), and the dividend rate (in the case of a preferred shares). Other recommendations may include call features or convertible features. THE FINAL PROSPECTUS The preliminary prospectus is reviewed by the securities regulators and, where required, amendments are made to the prospectus. Where a minimum offering is established, and satisfied, the final prospectus and the agency agreement (with the underwriting syndicate) is filed.

Where a prospectus contains a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d, each investor is deemed to have relied on the misrepresentation and has a right of action for damages against the offering issuer and possibly against each underwriter, director, officer, promoter or expert who signs the prospectus. Under secondary market civil liability, if an issuer releases a document that contains a misrepresentation, an investor who acquires or sells the issuer\u2019s security between the time when the document was released and the time when the misrepresentation was publicly corrected has a right of action for damages against the issuer and certain other parties", "released and the time when the misrepresentation was publicly corrected has a right of action for damages against the issuer and certain other parties.

Where timely disclosure has not been made, an investor who acquires or sells the issuer\u2019s security between the time when the material change was required to be disclosed and the time when it was subsequently disclosed has a right of action for damages against the issuer and certain other parties. THE SECONDARY MARKET After securities are initially sold to investors in the primary market, they are then traded in the secondary market by individual and institutional investors. There are three main types of secondary markets: \u2022 Stock Exchanges \u2022 Over-the-counter (OTC) markets \u2022 Alternative Trading Systems Most equity trades take place on an exchange.

The common and preferred shares of publicly listed companies are traded on the stock exchanges. Companies must apply to be listed on an exchange. If accepted, the company must comply with the exchange\u2019s listing requirements including the rules concerning the disclosure of information for reporting issuers.

WHAT IS THE EXEMPT MARKET? To understand the exempt market, you need to understand two fundamental concepts under securities law: \u2022 the prospectus requirement \u2022 the registration requirement Both requirements are intended to protect the investing public. The prospectus requirement requires an issuer to file a prospectus in order to distribute securities to the public. This is meant to ensure that investors are provided with relevant information about an issuer and its offering to help them make an informed investment decision. Securities offered by way of prospectus provide the investor with certain statutory rights in the event of a misrepresentation in a prospectus including the right to sue for damages. The registration requirement requires that parties involved in the business of trading or advising in securities become registered with the securities regulators. This is meant to ensure that individuals and firms who deal in securities are suitable and meet the requirements for proficiency, integrity, and solvency", "s is meant to ensure that individuals and firms who deal in securities are suitable and meet the requirements for proficiency, integrity, and solvency. The registration requirement also requires, among other things, that registrants comply with certain \u201cKnow Your Product\u201d, \u201cKnow Your Client\u201d, and suitability requirements. An exempt security is a security that is distributed under an exemption from the prospectus requirement or the dealer registration requirement. Securities that are offered for sale under an exemption from prospectus requirements are often called private placements. The market in which exempt securities are traded is known as the exempt market or private market. Originally, each jurisdiction of Canada had its own set of exemptions from the prospectus and registration requirements. The exemptions were largely harmonized when National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus and Registration Exemptions (NI 45-106) became effective in all jurisdictions of Canada", "largely harmonized when National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus and Registration Exemptions (NI 45-106) became effective in all jurisdictions of Canada. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 11 \u2022 22 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE have maintained local exemptions and, in certain cases, some jurisdictions have opted out of some of the exemptions in the instrument. RATIONALE FOR PROSPECTUS EXEMPTIONS Issuers must weigh the many considerations including costs, continuous disclosure requirements, timing, and corporate governance when deciding whether it is more beneficial to distribute their securities by way of a public distribution or a private placement. It is likely that the lower costs and reduced regulatory requirements associated with a private placement allow many issuers, who would not otherwise be willing or able, to access the capital markets. As such, private placements broaden the capital markets and play a vital role in the Canadian economy by facilitating access to capital. In certain circumstances, it may be more effective for small and medium sized issuers to raise capital in the exempt market", "itating access to capital. In certain circumstances, it may be more effective for small and medium sized issuers to raise capital in the exempt market.

Offering memorandums are also used by issuers for securities offered under exemptions other than the offering memorandum exemption, for example the accredited investor exemption", "so used by issuers for securities offered under exemptions other than the offering memorandum exemption, for example the accredited investor exemption. However, the offering memorandums under those exemptions are not required to comply with the requirements established in NI 45-106 for the offering memorandum exemption. The issuer is free to disclose as much or as little information as it wishes. To avoid confusion, the disclosures are sometimes referred to by a different name, such as information circular, but this is not always the case. Therefore, in most cases, the onus is on the investor to decide whether the disclosure document contains sufficient information to make an informed decision. Issuers that offer exempt securities are also not subject to the continuous reporting requirements for public issuers. Therefore, exempt securities are not transparent and investors may not be aware of the financial circumstances of the issuer. Unlike reporting issuers of publicly listed securities, there is no public repository for investors to obtain financial information on exempt issuers", "Unlike reporting issuers of publicly listed securities, there is no public repository for investors to obtain financial information on exempt issuers. INVESTOR RIGHTS Investors in exempt securities are not afforded the same legal rights that are available to investors who purchase prospectus-based investments. The right of action for damages for a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d are limited in comparison to prospectus-based securities. This means that there are limitations on the rights to claim damages or any other remedies from the issuer or underwriter for misstatements or misrepresentations in the offering documents, marketing documents, or any subsequent documents released or for failing to make timely disclosure of material changes. RESALE RESTRICTIONS Securities distributed pursuant to an exemption from the prospectus requirement are subject to resale restrictions, with the exception of those securities distributed under the government debt exemption, bank debt exemption, and short-term debt exemption. Those securities may be freely traded. The vast majority of exempt securities distributed by EMDs and Dealing Representatives are subject to resale restrictions", "rities may be freely traded. The vast majority of exempt securities distributed by EMDs and Dealing Representatives are subject to resale restrictions. The system is \u201cclosed\u201d and you cannot trade outside of a prospectus exemption unless: \u2022 the prospectus requirement is satisfied (i.e. the issuer becomes a reporting issuer) \u2022 certain resale restrictions are met The securities of issuers which are not reporting issuers may be subject to indefinite resale restrictions. This restricts securities issued under a prospectus exemption from entering the secondary market. COMPARISON: PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MARKET How securities are offered in the capital market depends on whether they are sold under a prospectus or under an exemption from the prospectus requirement. The public market is where the securities of publicly listed companies are offered by prospectus.

As established in CP 31-103, reasonable steps to identify material conflicts of interest would include: \u2022 taking proactive measures to anticipate reasonably foreseeable conflicts \u2022 implementing policies and procedures to identify existing conflicts \u2022 assessing the materiality of those conflicts to distinguish between those conflicts that are material and those that are not EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 44 \u2022 18 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE Figure 4.2 The duty to identify and address conflicts of interest is not viewed as a one-time exercise and compliance with the conflict of interest requirements is an ongoing obligation. Therefore, you are expected to assess and address new conflicts as they are identified. ADDRESSING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST A conflict of interest can be addressed in one of three ways: \u2022 avoidance \u2022 control \u2022 disclosure Where a conflict of interest between you and your client is identified, you are subject to specific regulatory obligations where the conflict is deemed to be material", "of interest between you and your client is identified, you are subject to specific regulatory obligations where the conflict is deemed to be material. You must: \u2022 address all material conflicts of interest in the best interest of the client \u2022 avoid all material conflicts of interest where the conflict cannot be addressed in the best interest of the client When addressing a material conflict of interest, you and your EMD are required to either: \u2022 implement controls to mitigate the conflict sufficiently so that the conflict is addressed in the client\u2019s best interest; or \u2022 avoid the conflict. Your failure to identify and properly address a conflict could put you and your EMD at risk of disciplinary action by the regulators or civil action by a client. Therefore, it is important that you understand and commit to the notion that you must address all material conflicts of interest in the best interest of the client and avoid those material conflicts of interest that cannot be addressed in the best interest of the client. AVOIDANCE You are required to avoid all conflicts of interest that are prohibited by law", "that cannot be addressed in the best interest of the client. AVOIDANCE You are required to avoid all conflicts of interest that are prohibited by law. Examples of conflicts of interest that must be avoided include those practices prohibited under securities legislation and regulations, or other activity that is sufficiently contrary to the integrity of the capital market and/or the interests of investor(s). Even where a conflict of interest is not legally prohibited, it must be avoided if there can be no other reasonable response. Under CP 31-103, Part 13, Division 2, s", "nflict of interest is not legally prohibited, it must be avoided if there can be no other reasonable response. Under CP 31-103, Part 13, Division 2, s. 13.4.1, you would be expected to avoid material conflicts of interest: \u2022 where there are no appropriate controls available that would address the conflict in the best interest of the client LESSON 3 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 4 \u2022 19 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE \u2022 where avoiding the conflict is the only reasonable response in order to address the conflict in the best interest of the client \u2022 even if avoiding the conflict means foregoing an otherwise attractive business opportunity or type of compensation Where you determine that a material conflict of interest should be avoided, you may do so by: \u2022 refusing to engage in the activity \u2022 ceasing to provide the product or service \u2022 declining to deal with the client CONTROL When determining how to address material conflicts of interest, your EMD must consider what internal structures or policies and procedures can be implemented in order to address the conflict of interest in the best interest of the client", "what internal structures or policies and procedures can be implemented in order to address the conflict of interest in the best interest of the client. CONFLICTS ARISING FROM COMPENSATION AND INCENTIVES It is important to note that the regulators assign a great deal of importance to conflicts arising from compensation and incentives. As such, you should focus specific attention to your EMD\u2019s policies and procedures governing conflicts that arise from compensation and incentives to ensure that: \u2022 you adhere to the firm\u2019s requirements \u2022 conflicts of interest are addressed in the best interests of clients Conflicts arising from internal compensation arrangements and incentive practices As stated in CP 31-103, s. 13.4.1: \u201cIt is an inherent conflict of interest for registered firms to create incentives to sell or recommend certain products or services over others. It is also an inherent conflict of interest for registered individuals to receive greater compensation from their sponsoring firm for the sale or recommendation of certain products or services over others", "ered individuals to receive greater compensation from their sponsoring firm for the sale or recommendation of certain products or services over others. In our experience these are almost always material conflicts of interest.\u201d The CP goes on to state: \u201cIn addition to controlling these conflicts in the best interest of clients, registrants must comply with the suitability determination obligation under section 13.3. If certain products or services available at a firm compensate its registered individuals better than others, in addition to determining that the recommendation is suitable, registered individuals must put their clients\u2019 interest first when deciding which product or service to recommend. As a result, the client\u2019s interests, not the registrant\u2019s interests, must guide the recommendations made by a registrant to its clients. Registrants must not recommend a product or service just because it pays them better than the alternatives", "ations made by a registrant to its clients. Registrants must not recommend a product or service just because it pays them better than the alternatives. This is also consistent with a registrant\u2019s obligation to deal fairly, honestly and in good faith with its clients.\u201d DISCLOSURE The purpose of disclosing a conflict of interest is to provide the client with adequate information so that they can decide for themselves whether the conflict is serious enough to lead them to withdraw from the transaction or service. EMDs are required to provide written disclosure to clients to disclose all material conflicts of interest identified and reported to the firm.

In some cases, you will be required to provide disclosure to the client when these circumstances arise. While disclosure can be effective in addressing certain conflicts of interest, disclosure alone is not considered sufficient to address a material conflict of interest between a registrant and a client. Disclosure is meant to supplement other measures and controls taken to address the conflicts. EXAMPLE Fadila is a Dealing Representative with InvestRite Inc., an exempt market dealer. Fadila\u2019s client, Harbinder, buys flow-through shares and needs help completing his tax return, which is complex for flow-through shares. Luckily, Fadila has an ownership interest in Pro-Tax Services Ltd., a tax preparation firm. Before Fadila can refer Harbinder to Pro-Tax Services she must: \u2022 obtain approval from InvestRite Inc. for her outside activity, Pro-Tax Services Ltd. \u2022 obtain approval from InvestRite Inc. for the written disclosure for Pro-Tax Services Ltd., which must clearly disclose Fadila\u2019s conflicts of interest (e.g", "in approval from InvestRite Inc. for the written disclosure for Pro-Tax Services Ltd., which must clearly disclose Fadila\u2019s conflicts of interest (e.g. Fadila will profit from her interest in Pro-Tax when Harbinder uses the service) \u2022 provide the written disclosure for Pro-Tax Services Ltd. to her client, Harbinder, before she refers him to Pro- Tax DISCLOSURE OF COMPENSATION CONFLICTS As set out in CP 31-103, s. 13.4.1, you are expected to disclose to your clients any commissions or other compensation that you will receive for a transaction, before the transaction is executed. The CP also explicitly states: \u201cIf a representative\u2019s compensation differs depending on the products or services provided, then this is a material conflict that must be disclosed to clients. With respect to the nature and extent of the conflict, the registrant should disclose a summary of the compensation conflict in plain language", "lients. With respect to the nature and extent of the conflict, the registrant should disclose a summary of the compensation conflict in plain language. For example, if particular products pay a larger percentage-commission than other products available to the client, the extent of the compensation difference should be explained.\u201d LIMITATIONS OF DISCLOSURE In some cases, disclosure can play an effective part in addressing conflicts of interest. However, disclosure alone would not be considered sufficient to address a material conflict of interest. For example, compensation and transaction charges are disclosed in the Relationship Disclosure Information (RDI) that is provided to clients when they open an account and in the Pre-Trade disclosure before an order is executed. However, there is an added LESSON 3 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 4 \u2022 21 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE expectation that there is adequate supervision by the firm to ensure that the fees are competitive, reasonable, and appropriate for clients. There are also circumstances where disclosure would be clearly insufficient to address a conflict of interest. In such cases, you would need to avoid the conflict of interest", "nces where disclosure would be clearly insufficient to address a conflict of interest. In such cases, you would need to avoid the conflict of interest. For example, disclosure may not be used to justify an unsuitable recommendation. EXAMPLE As noted by the Hearing Panel in the 2020 decision of the Alberta Securities Commission in Re Rustulka1: \u201c[228] \u2026we reiterate that a registrant\u2019s suitability obligation is not discharged just because a client has said that he or she knew of or accepted the risk of an investment, or because he or she has signed documents to that effect. We agree with the panel in Lamoureux that, \u201cno amount of disclosure to the investor, or acknowledgement by the investor, can convert an unsuitable investment into a suitable investment\u201d (at p. 28) or displace a registrant\u2019s obligation to conduct a proper suitability assessment (at p. 16). In the decision, the Dealing Representative was found to have breached his KYC and suitability obligations. Once a conflict of interest has been identified and addressed, you must document the reasonable basis for your determination that the conflict of interest has been addressed in the best interests of the client(s)", "you must document the reasonable basis for your determination that the conflict of interest has been addressed in the best interests of the client(s). As the materiality of a conflict increases, there should be greater detail in the records maintained to demonstrate compliance. For example, the regulators would expect to see more detailed records for material conflicts related to sales practices, compensation arrangements, incentive practices, referral arrangements, and the use of proprietary products and services.

In making a referral, registered firms and individuals must be guided only by the client\u2019s interests. We therefore expect that a registrant will not make a client referral to a party solely because of the referral fee that they will receive from that party, or because the amount or duration of the referral fee that they will receive from that party may be greater than the amount or duration of the referral fee that they would receive from a competitor to that party.

The investor must choose one of the following conversion options: \u2022 De-register the RRSP and receive a lump-sum cash payment \u2022 Convert the RRSP into a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) \u2022 Purchase an annuity A RRIF acts the same as an RRSP in the sense that any income earned in the RRIF is tax-deferred until paid out", "ncome fund (RRIF) \u2022 Purchase an annuity A RRIF acts the same as an RRSP in the sense that any income earned in the RRIF is tax-deferred until paid out. However, unlike an RRSP, clients cannot make new contributions to a RRIF and a minimum amount of income from the RRIF must be paid to your client each year which is taxable. REGISTERED EDUCATION SAVINGS PLANS The purpose of registered education savings plans (RESPs) is to help parents and grandparents plan and save for their children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s future education. These plans are legal contracts between a subscriber (like your client) and a plan promoter (like a bank or trust company). Your client can make contributions to the plan of up to $50,000 per beneficiary over a maximum of 31 years. The federal government provides a grant of up to $500 for each year the beneficiary is under 18, to a maximum of $7 ,200 per beneficiary. The investment income earned in an RESP is not taxed until it is withdrawn. Once the beneficiary enrolls as a full-time student in a qualifying educational program at a qualifying post-secondary institution, money can be withdrawn from the RESP", "ry enrolls as a full-time student in a qualifying educational program at a qualifying post-secondary institution, money can be withdrawn from the RESP. A portion of the payments are taxable in the hands of the beneficiary at that time based on the income accumulated in the plan including the government grant. LESSON 6 REGISTERED PLANS 4 \u2022 49 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE QUALIFIED INVESTMENTS Only specific types of investments are allowed to be held in registered plans. Some of the common types of qualified investments are outlined in the table below. Qualified Investments \u2022 money and deposits (including foreign currencies) \u2022 Canadian government bonds (federal, provincial, or municipal) \u2022 guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and term deposits \u2022 securities listed on a designated stock exchange in or outside Canada (e.g", "municipal) \u2022 guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and term deposits \u2022 securities listed on a designated stock exchange in or outside Canada (e.g. TSX, NYSE) \u2022 mutual fund trust units and mutual fund corporation shares \u2022 certain Canadian mortgages \u2022 certain corporate bonds \u2022 certain shares of private corporations \u2022 registered investments REGISTERED INVESTMENTS A registered investment is a type of pooled investment vehicle which has been pre-approved by the Canada Revenue Agency as being a qualified investment for registered plans. These types of investments take one of four forms: \u2022 mutual fund trusts \u2022 pooled fund trusts \u2022 mutual fund corporations \u2022 investment corporations There are also \u201cquasi\u201d variations of each of these four types. Each year, the CRA publishes a list of registered investments in the Canada Gazette and online. PENALTIES FOR NON-QUALIFIED INVESTMENTS If the exempt product your client holds in his or her registered plan is \u201cnon-qualified\u201d, the client will be subject to a penalty tax", "FIED INVESTMENTS If the exempt product your client holds in his or her registered plan is \u201cnon-qualified\u201d, the client will be subject to a penalty tax. For an RESP, if your client holds non-qualified investments in the plan, the registered status may be revoked and all income or gains earned may be subject to tax at the top marginal rate. If the RESP is not revoked but still holds non-qualified investments, the plan will pay a 1% penalty tax on the future market value of the non- qualified investments (as measured at acquisition) for each month that the plan holds the investments. PROHIBITED INVESTMENTS Some specific investment types have been prohibited by the CRA from being held in registered plans. Generally, a prohibited investment is one that is \u201cclosely-held\u201d, such as: \u2022 Closely connected debts (personal debts not including a mortgage insured by an approved insurer). \u2022 This is a debt of the individual who controls the registered plan. Note that this does not include a mortgage insured by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) or an approved private insurer", "gistered plan. Note that this does not include a mortgage insured by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) or an approved private insurer. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 44 \u2022 50 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE \u2022 Corporation shares, trust units, or partnership units where the annuitant or related parties own a significant interest. \u2022 Shares, trust units, or partnership units bought into a registered plan cannot represent 10% or more of the value of the corporation, trust, or partnership either alone, or together with related parties. It is therefore important to understand not only what your client is investing in, but also the investments of their spouses, children, or other related persons. A debt or share of, or an interest in, a corporation, trust, or partnership with which the registered plan holder does not deal at arm\u2019s length may also be prohibited. PENALTIES FOR PROHIBITED INVESTMENTS There are two types of penalties for holding a prohibited investment in a registered plan: \u2022 A 50% tax payable by the client on the total future market value of the prohibited investment", "holding a prohibited investment in a registered plan: \u2022 A 50% tax payable by the client on the total future market value of the prohibited investment. This tax may be refunded if the investment was acquired in error and is disposed of by the end of the year after the year it was acquired. \u2022 A 100% tax on any income or gains earned on the investments. This tax may be waived where the CRA determines it should not be applicable. In cases where a client holds prohibited investments, it is important that they seek professional tax advice to transition out of the plan. TRUSTEE Except in the case of a TFSA, the Income Tax Act of Canada requires that savings through a registered vehicle be held by a trustee. Where a trustee has transacted any business or permitted any situation to exist that created a tax liability, it will be responsible for filing an information return with a payment for any balance due no later than 90 days after the end of the calendar year.

This lesson takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this lesson, you will be able to: 1 | Provide an overview of private placements. 2 | Define the purpose of the Engagement Letter. 3 | Explain the importance of knowing what transactions are covered. 4 | Describe the components of the Engagement Letter including fee arrangements, expenses, terms, and indemnification clauses", "ransactions are covered. 4 | Describe the components of the Engagement Letter including fee arrangements, expenses, terms, and indemnification clauses. OVERVIEW OF PRIVATE PLACEMENTS Many EMDs will have a corporate finance team to manage private placements including structuring products, conducting due diligence, and producing documentation. The Dealing Representatives will have little involvement in the inception of private placements under this business model. However, in some cases, such as at small firms that do not have a corporate finance team, the Dealing Representative may be more involved. Regardless of the extent of your involvement, it is important to have a general understanding of the process and components of a private placement. Figure 5.1 Agency Agreement Subscription Agreement ClosingEngagement Letter The private placement starts with the Engagement Letter, then the Agency Agreement and Subscription Agreement, and culminates with the closing of the transaction. THE ENGAGEMENT LETTER The Engagement Letter is the formal contract whereby the issuer retains the EMD to provide its services", "sing of the transaction. THE ENGAGEMENT LETTER The Engagement Letter is the formal contract whereby the issuer retains the EMD to provide its services. It is a critical document because it is binding in nature and sets out the formal obligations of both the EMD and the issuer in connection with the proposed commitment to raise capital. The Engagement Letter includes the following components: \u2022 covered transactions \u2022 fee arrangements and broker warrants \u2022 nature of the engagement \u2022 expenses \u2022 term of engagement EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 55 \u2022 4 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE \u2022 fee tail \u2022 right of first refusal \u2022 indemnification COVERED TRANSACTIONS One of the primary issues addressed in the Engagement Letter is the transactions that are covered. The covered transactions drive the process and form the basis of the EMD\u2019s fee. The EMD will try to cast a wide net to cover any type of capital raising transaction, which triggers the issuer\u2019s obligation to pay the EMD\u2019s success fee", "EMD will try to cast a wide net to cover any type of capital raising transaction, which triggers the issuer\u2019s obligation to pay the EMD\u2019s success fee. Similarly, an issuer will want the covered transactions to be more narrowly defined; specifying the EMD\u2019s exact duties to raise a specified amount of capital in a specified form (such as debt versus equity). EXAMPLE Fairbid Corp. retains Blue Sky Capital Inc. to raise $2 million of financing. Blue Sky, the EMD, would want the covered transactions to include any combination of debt or equity. If Blue Sky was only able to source $2 million of debt and the covered transaction in the Engagement Letter speaks only to raising equity, then legally speaking, Blue Sky has not fulfilled its mandate and no compensation would be payable if a debt fundraising transaction were to close. For the issuer to ensure that certain transactions are not unintentionally included, the definition of a covered transaction should be carefully negotiated to account for particular carve-outs", "sactions are not unintentionally included, the definition of a covered transaction should be carefully negotiated to account for particular carve-outs. For example, where the minimum amount of capital to be raised is $2 million in equity, this should be specified such that if the EMD raises only $1 million of equity, the EMD would not be entitled to compensation. In addition, there may be circumstances where certain subscribers should be specifically excluded from covered transactions. For example, where the issuer has pre- existing relationships with certain subscribers, it would not be appropriate for the EMD to receive any compensation for those pre-existing subscribers who would have subscribed to the offering regardless. The scope of the services to be rendered by the EMD should also be established in explicit terms in order to ensure that that the issuer\u2019s expectations of the EMD are fully satisfied", "rendered by the EMD should also be established in explicit terms in order to ensure that that the issuer\u2019s expectations of the EMD are fully satisfied. FEE ARRANGEMENT AND BROKER WARRANTS Another critical component of the engagement is the negotiation of the fee arrangement, which is comprised of the following 3 elements: \u2022 work fee \u2022 cash compensation \u2022 broker warrant WORK FEE EMD\u2019s will often seek a non-refundable \u201cwork fee\u201d to cover their basic costs. The exact amount depends on the size and complexity of the proposed offering. Commonly, the work fee for a $2 million offering would be in the range of 1%, or $20,000. In some situations, the EMD will waive the work fee in order to induce the issuer to sign the Engagement Letter. CASH COMPENSATION The primary source of compensation for the EMD will be a success fee for a completed offering. The success fee can range anywhere from 2% to 10% of the total amount raised depending on whether the offering is debt (attracting a lower success fee) or equity (attracting a higher success fee). LESSON 1 THE ENGAGEMENT LETTER 5 \u2022 5 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXAMPLE Blue Sky Capital Inc", "ss fee) or equity (attracting a higher success fee). LESSON 1 THE ENGAGEMENT LETTER 5 \u2022 5 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXAMPLE Blue Sky Capital Inc. negotiates a 5% success fee with their client Fairbid Corp. On a $2 million equity offering, they would receive $100,000. BROKER WARRANT In a private placement, it is common for the issuer to issue warrants to the EMD as consideration for their services. This allows the EMD to acquire a certain portion of the equity offering, for a period of time (usually stated in years), at the same price offered to third parties. The terms of the broker warrants issued to the EMD are negotiated in advance and are specifically set out in the Engagement Letter. Broker warrants often represent one of the most valuable components of the EMD\u2019s and Dealing Representative\u2019s compensation. It is not uncommon to see anywhere from 5% to 10% broker warrant entitlement to the EMD with a lifespan of 2 to 3 years. EXAMPLE Blue Sky Capital Inc. is negotiating a $2 million offering in the private market for its client Fairbid Corp. The equity offering is being done at $5 per share (400,000 common shares issued)", "2 million offering in the private market for its client Fairbid Corp. The equity offering is being done at $5 per share (400,000 common shares issued). They agree to a 5% broker warrant entitlement with a 2 year lifespan. Blue Sky is entitled to receive 20,000 broker warrants at the purchase price of $5, the value of which equals $100,000. One year into the 2 year term, Fairbid Corp. goes public and its shares trade at $15. The value of the broker warrant increases to $200,000 (20,000 broker warrants \u00d7 $15 = $300,000 less the exercise price of $100,000). In this example, the broker warrants provide more compensation than a 5% cash commission. Often, EMDs will build up a pool or book of broker warrants from multiple placements which can provide significant future value to the EMD and the Dealing Representative. It is important to note that the securities commissions and regulators have rules on the transferability of broker warrants", "he Dealing Representative. It is important to note that the securities commissions and regulators have rules on the transferability of broker warrants. NATURE OF THE ENGAGEMENT The Engagement Letter should clearly set out whether the EMD\u2019s engagement by the issuer is: \u2022 exclusive: the issuer may not retain the services of any other EMD during the term \u2022 non-exclusive: the issuer may retain the services of other EMD\u2019s during the term \u2022 non-exclusive with a protected list: the issuer may engage the services of other EMD\u2019s during the term, but the EMD will be protected in terms of compensation for those investors identified on the protected list Best practice dictates that the nature of the mandate is clearly set out in writing in the Engagement Letter with specific references concerning the \u201cexclusive\u201d, \u201cnon-exclusive\u201d or \u201cnon-exclusive with a protected list\u201d nature of the engagement. The mandate should never be vague and the component establishing the nature of the engagement must be consistent with the other sections of the agreement, specifically in relation to the provisions concerning the EMD\u2019s compensation", "e engagement must be consistent with the other sections of the agreement, specifically in relation to the provisions concerning the EMD\u2019s compensation. NON-EXCLUSIVE If the nature of the engagement is not specified, it will likely be deemed to be non-exclusive, giving the issuer the right to engage other EMDs during the term of the Engagement Letter. The first EMD receives compensation only for those investors it introduces and for which there is a closing during the term. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 55 \u2022 6 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXCLUSIVE If the mandate specified is exclusive, it will entitle the EMD to exclusive representation of the issuer during the term of the Engagement Letter and the right to receive compensation for any amounts raised during the term, regardless of how the investment is procured, whether the EMD introduces or procures the investor or the investor comes from another source without the EMD\u2019s involvement", "he investment is procured, whether the EMD introduces or procures the investor or the investor comes from another source without the EMD\u2019s involvement. NON-EXCLUSIVE WITH PROTECTED LIST The non-exclusive with protected list mandate is a hybrid, occupying the middle ground between the exclusive and non-exclusive mandate, where the issuer is free to retain the services of other EMDs during the term of the Engagement Letter, but the first EMD will be compensated on a success basis for investors they: \u2022 specifically identified on the protected list (the protected list is usually appended to the Engagement Letter) \u2022 procured or introduced and who are not identified on the protected list LIMITED PROTECTED LIST A slight variation to the protected list mandate is the limited protected list mandate, where the EMD is to solicit only those investors specifically identified on the protected list. This type of mandate is often used where the EMD has no pre-existing relationship with the issuer, but approaches them because the EMD believes it can source funding from a specific investor", "the EMD has no pre-existing relationship with the issuer, but approaches them because the EMD believes it can source funding from a specific investor. The issuer may be cautious about granting a mandate to the EMD other than a limited one specifically to investor(s) on the protected list. THE CAVEATS WITH THE NON-EXCLUSIVE MANDATE Unsophisticated or first-time issuers sometimes assume that a non-exclusive engagement is in their best interests and try at the outset to resist an exclusive engagement. The issuer\u2019s reasoning could be that a non-exclusive engagement could provide the issuer with more flexibility to engage more \u201cfeet on the street\u201d to raise capital through various EMD\u2019s simultaneously. However, the issuer should consider the negative consequences of \u201cdeal collision\u201d that could result where two different EMDs approach the same investor at the same time. The issuer and EMD may only have one chance to make a good first impression with a potential investor and an uncoordinated, duplicative marketing approach may reflect poorly on the investment opportunity", "good first impression with a potential investor and an uncoordinated, duplicative marketing approach may reflect poorly on the investment opportunity. As a Dealing Representative, you should be prepared to explain the advantages, disadvantages, and appropriateness of each mandate. Optimal results for a successful offering are achieved when the EMD has a proven track record of raising capital in the issuer\u2019s industry, such as mining or biotech, and the EMD is in a position to create a professional, coordinated, and controlled auction for the investment opportunity. EXPENSES Another important component for negotiation is the reimbursement of expenses to the EMD in connection with the offering. While the EMD will want to have all expenses connected with the offering reimbursed, the issuer will want some control. The issuer may require that the EMD obtain prior written approval for expenses above a certain dollar threshold and may put a dollar cap on legal and other professional expenses. The issuer may also require that expenses be paid out of the closing proceeds, only if a successful closing occurs", "al and other professional expenses. The issuer may also require that expenses be paid out of the closing proceeds, only if a successful closing occurs. TERM OF ENGAGEMENT Negotiation of the engagement will always include the term of the engagement. Common practice is to state the term of the engagement as a fixed duration in the Engagement Letter, usually not less than 1 year with automatic renewal rights thereafter. Commonly, there are provisions which allow either the EMD or the issuer to terminate the mandate early without cause, usually on 30 days prior written notice. LESSON 1 THE ENGAGEMENT LETTER 5 \u2022 7 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE FEE-TAIL The fee-tail is a provision in the Engagement Letter which states that if the engagement is terminated by either the EMD or the issuer, and a transaction is consummated with a party who was \u201cintroduced\u201d by the EMD within a designated period after termination, the EMD will be entitled to payment of its fees in full as if the engagement was not terminated. The designated period of time, known as the \u201ctail period\u201d, is typically between 12 and 24 months", "fees in full as if the engagement was not terminated. The designated period of time, known as the \u201ctail period\u201d, is typically between 12 and 24 months. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL The Right of First Refusal (ROFR) is another important section of the Engagement Letter. When ROFR is granted, after the successful completion of the offering, the EMD is entitled to the right of first refusal to act as the exclusive advisor to the issuer on any future offering over a specified period of time, usually no longer than 2 years. It requires the issuer to offer the EMD the right to act as financial advisor on a future offering before another EMD can be retained. INDEMNIFICATION In most Engagement Letters, the issuer will agree to indemnify the EMD from any claims which the EMD suffers as a result of the engagement, other than willful misconduct or gross negligence of the EMD. The indemnification provisions are important for a number of reasons, not the least of which is because the EMD brings investors to the investment based on the due diligence information provided by the issuer, including financial and operational data", "use the EMD brings investors to the investment based on the due diligence information provided by the issuer, including financial and operational data. If the due diligence data turns out to be incorrect, and the investors suffer a financial loss, the EMD may be sued by investors. The indemnification provisions provide the legal basis for the EMD to seek recourse against the issuer. \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE 2Agency Agreement CONTENT AREAS The Agency Agreement LESSON 2 AGENCY AGREEMENT 5 \u2022 11 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE INTRODUCTION In this lesson you will learn about the Agency Agreement between the EMD and the issuer. This lesson takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this lesson, you will be able to: 1 | Define the purpose of the Agency Agreement. 2 | Describe the components of the Agency Agreement including terms of the offering, closing conditions, representations and warranties, and indemnification", "scribe the components of the Agency Agreement including terms of the offering, closing conditions, representations and warranties, and indemnification. THE AGENCY AGREEMENT The Agency Agreement is the formal agreement between the issuer and the EMD (the \u201cagent\u201d) whereby the issuer agrees to appoint the agent, and the agent agrees to act for the issuer in connection with the sale of securities. Not every offering will use a formal Agency Agreement. In some instances, especially where the size of the offering is relatively small, the Engagement Letter together with a more comprehensive Subscription Agreement will be used as the main documents to establish the relationship between the issuer, the EMD, and investors. It is common practice to use a formal Agency Agreement where there are multiple investors and the offering is sizeable in terms of dollar amount. The Agency Agreement will supersede and replace the Engagement Letter upon signing of the Agency Agreement. TERMS OF THE OFFERING The Agency Agreement is the formal agreement which establishes the specific terms of the offering of securities including the amount to be offered, price, and jurisdictions of the offering", "eement which establishes the specific terms of the offering of securities including the amount to be offered, price, and jurisdictions of the offering. In contrast, the Engagement Letter will very often leave the specific terms of the offering undefined and subject to negotiation and acceptance by the issuer at a later date. DEALER COMPENSATION The Agency Agreement establishes the EMD\u2019s compensation as negotiated in the Engagement Letter, but will set these terms out in greater commercial detail. SCOPE OF SERVICES The Agency Agreement establishes the scope of services to be provided by the EMD as negotiated in the Engagement Letter including specifics as to whether the relationship is exclusive or non-exclusive. In the Agency Agreement, the EMD also agrees to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to raise the funds according to the terms set out in the agreement.

Where an Agency Agreement is used, the representations and warranties contained in the Subscription Agreement will typically be less extensive. INDEMNIFICATION The indemnification provisions in the Agency Agreement provide a contractual remedy and outlines the steps required in the event a claim is made concerning a breach of any representation of warranty or covenant", "de a contractual remedy and outlines the steps required in the event a claim is made concerning a breach of any representation of warranty or covenant. It is important to note that the subscribers (investors) are not a party to the Engagement Letter or the beneficiary of its terms. The Agency Agreement is the contractual link between each subscriber (investor) and the issuer when it comes to representations, warranties, and covenants as well as indemnification provisions. Most claims are made by the investor against the advisor or the EMD. \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE 3 CONTENT AREAS The Subscription Agreement Subscription Agreement LESSON 3 SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT 5 \u2022 15 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE INTRODUCTION In this lesson you will learn about the Subscription Agreement between the issuer and the investor.

EXAMPLE Joe is one of the individuals named on the protected list of the Engagement Letter between Fairbid Corp. and Blue Sky Capital Inc. He buys $200,000 securities under the accredited investor exemption. The Subscription Agreement captures his wish to have the securities registered in his broker\u2019s account. PROSPECTUS EXEMPTION The subscriber must confirm the exact prospectus exemption that he/she is relying on to subscribe for the securities in the private placement (e.g. accredited investor exemption). This is of utmost importance to the EMD in fulfilling their obligation to qualify the client for exemption.

The holders of any class of shares, including non-voting shares, are entitled to vote in order to protect themselves where changes are proposed to the class or series of shares they own. This fundamental statutory protection of shareholders ensures that the rights represented by the shares they hold are not eroded or diminished in any way without an opportunity to prevent it.

The shares represent ownership in the corporation, also known as share capital. The share capital of the corporation includes the common and preferred shares issued and outstanding. COMMON SHARES Common shares represent units of ownership in a company and returns are derived from the appreciation or depreciation in the share\u2019s value which is driven by the company\u2019s profitability. The typical features of common shares are: \u2022 Voting: unless otherwise specified, common shares entitle the holder to one vote per share and carry a right to receive notice of and to attend and vote at all meetings of shareholders", ", common shares entitle the holder to one vote per share and carry a right to receive notice of and to attend and vote at all meetings of shareholders. \u2022 Dividends: there are no contractual obligations for a company to pay dividends to common shareholders, although dividends are often paid on the common shares of highly profitable companies. \u2022 Participation on dissolution: common shareholders may participate in the remaining property of the corporation upon dissolution, after the holders of bonds, debentures, and preferred shares. OTHER CLASSES OF SHARES Other classes of shares issued by a corporation would include: \u2022 Preferred shares \u2022 Special shares \u2022 Class A shares, Class B shares, etc. \u2022 Multiple voting shares \u2022 Subordinate voting shares Classes of shares can vary greatly and can be designed to achieve very specific objectives.

The provisions in the articles of the corporation will contain the following: \u201cThe Corporation is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares.\u201d Where the corporation has common shares and no other class of shares, there is no requirement to state the specific rights of the holders of those shares. The holders of common shares in these circumstances will have the three rights: voting, dividends, and participation on dissolution. EXAMPLE Wernerwave Corp. has authorized two classes of shares, common shares and preferred shares", "voting, dividends, and participation on dissolution. EXAMPLE Wernerwave Corp. has authorized two classes of shares, common shares and preferred shares. Therefore, it is necessary for the corporation to describe the rights for the two classes of shares in its articles of the corporation. With respect to the common shares, the articles would typically specify that the common shares are subordinate to the preferred shares in respect of dividends and participation upon liquidation, dissolution, or wind-up of the corporation. When a corporation has issued multiple classes of shares or is authorized to issue multiple classes of shares, you must know the rights applicable to all classes of shares in order to assess the shares in the offering. DIVIDEND CONSIDERATIONS Corporate legislation prevents a corporation from making certain payments, such as dividend payments, if making the payment would result in the corporation being unable to meet its obligations as they become due. Therefore, in certain circumstances where a company is in distress, a corporation may not pay dividends even where they are provided for in the corporation\u2019s articles", "rtain circumstances where a company is in distress, a corporation may not pay dividends even where they are provided for in the corporation\u2019s articles. Therefore, in assessing a class of shares, you must consider whether the corporation is able to make dividend payments as provided for in the articles and if so, whether it is reasonable to assume that it will continue to be able to pay dividends. TAX CONSIDERATIONS The tax considerations of any investment should be determined in consultation with a professional tax adviser. For information purposes, the general tax considerations in relation to corporations are outlined below. INCOME OF THE CORPORATION A corporation is a separate and distinct entity and, like a natural person, a corporation is a taxpayer. Corporations generally pay a flat tax rate based on the type of income and the type of corporation, as compared to the graduated marginal tax rates which are applied to individuals based on income thresholds. Income earned by a corporation is taxed to the corporation. The corporation then pays dividends to its shareholders out of the net \u201cafter-tax\u201d income. The shareholders are taxed on the dividends they earn on their shares", "ation then pays dividends to its shareholders out of the net \u201cafter-tax\u201d income. The shareholders are taxed on the dividends they earn on their shares. In absence of special measures, the same income would be taxed twice: 1. the corporation is taxed; and 2. the shareholder is taxed. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 66 \u2022 10 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE In order to avoid double taxation on the same income, the Income Tax Act of Canada has systems in place, including the \u201cimputation system\u201d. How the dividends are treated from a tax perspective depends on: \u2022 the type of corporation: public corporation, private corporation, Canadian-controlled private corporation \u2022 the recipient of the dividend: individual or corporation TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS Dividends paid to individual shareholders are treated under the imputation system. The objective of the imputation system is to treat the dividend income in such a way so that the dividends are only taxed once. In order to achieve this, a calculation is performed to treat the dividend income as follows: 1", "such a way so that the dividends are only taxed once. In order to achieve this, a calculation is performed to treat the dividend income as follows: 1. The actual amount of the dividend paid to the shareholder is \u201cgrossed up\u201d by the tax rate of the corporation Formula: Gross-Up Dividend A + (A \u00d7 B) = C Where: A = the actual amount of the dividend paid to the shareholder B = the corporation\u2019s tax rate C = the grossed up amount of dividends 2. The shareholder is taxed on the grossed up amount of the dividend (notionally, the shareholder\u2019s portion of the gross \u201cpre-tax\u201d income corresponding to the dividend) 3. The dividend tax credit is deducted from the shareholder\u2019s tax payable (notionally, the amount of the tax the corporation paid as a \u201cpre-payment\u201d on behalf of the shareholder) From a tax perspective, dividends from Canadian corporations are categorized into 2 categories: \u2022 Eligible dividends: paid by large corporations that are typically public companies \u2022 Other dividends: paid by small, private corporations Different tax rates and rates for the gross-up and the dividend tax credit apply depending on whether the dividends are eligible dividends versus other dividends", "ax rates and rates for the gross-up and the dividend tax credit apply depending on whether the dividends are eligible dividends versus other dividends. For dividends paid to a Canadian corporation, the dividends are not subject to a gross-up and dividend tax credit. Instead, the dividends will generally be deductible in computing the corporate shareholder\u2019s taxable income to avoid double tax. Private corporations generally are subject to a 33 1/3% refundable tax on dividends received. This refundable tax generally will be refunded to a corporate shareholder at the rate of $1 for every $3 of taxable dividends paid while it is a private corporation. CAPITAL GAINS A capital gain is the profit on the disposition of property that is not otherwise included in income. Financial instruments such as shares, bonds, and mutual funds are examples of property that are subject to capital gains if disposition results in a profit. The amount of the capital gain is the difference between the proceeds of disposition and the total of: \u2022 the adjusted cost base of the asset; and \u2022 the expenses incurred to dispose of the asset", "rence between the proceeds of disposition and the total of: \u2022 the adjusted cost base of the asset; and \u2022 the expenses incurred to dispose of the asset. LESSON 1 CORPORATIONS 6 \u2022 11 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE Capital gains are not taxed in full. The portion of a capital gain which must be included in the taxpayer\u2019s income is the \u201ctaxable capital gain\u201d. In order to determine the taxable capital gain, the capital gain is multiplied by the \u201cinclusion rate\u201d.

If capital losses exceed capital gains for a given tax year, the capital loss may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding years or carried forward and deducted in any following years against capital gains realized in those years. CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION Individuals are entitled to claim a lifetime exemption of taxable capital gains to shelter gains realized on shares of certain types of corporations such as Canadian-controlled private corporations, family farm corporations, and family fishing corporations.

A partnership is an unincorporated business owned by two or more partners. Partnership agreements can be structured as: \u2022 General Partnerships \u2022 Limited Partnerships Under a general partnership, all the partners are \u201cgeneral partners\u201d who have the same rights and obligations and they are all legally liable for the debts, losses, damages, or obligations of the partnership (unlimited liability). Each partner is an agent of the partnership and of the other partners, and therefore the actions of one partner binds each of the other partners. Each partner is jointly and severally liable with all of the other partners. A limited partnership establishes \u201climited partners\u201d, in addition to the \u201cgeneral partners\u201d, who do not have obligations or liabilities beyond the amounts they contributed to the partnership. The \u201climited partners\u201d are not permitted to be actively involved in the business or affairs of the partnership and if they do engage in such activities, they lose their \u201climited liability\u201d benefits", "actively involved in the business or affairs of the partnership and if they do engage in such activities, they lose their \u201climited liability\u201d benefits. From an investment perspective, most issuers will be structured as a limited partnership and it would be rare to issue securities under a general partnership since investors would want limited liability. Regardless of the partnership structure, the partnership is not a separate legal entity like a corporation. Limited partnerships also do not benefit from an extensive code of rules established under governing statute and they do not benefit from the protections that corporations do. All considerations relating to rights and protections are a matter of contract between the parties. Contracts will vary from case to case, so due diligence will be required in order to fully understand the parameters of a limited partnership. This lack of uniformity makes issuers structured as limited partnerships less predictable than corporations.

The liability of a corporation does not flow through to the owners of the corporation (i.e., its shareholders).

EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 66 \u2022 20 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE TAX CONSIDERATIONS The tax considerations of any investment should be determined in consultation with a professional tax adviser. For information purposes, the general tax considerations in relation to limited partnership units are outlined below. ALLOCATION OF INCOME AND TAXES A limited partnership is not a separate legal entity like a corporation. Therefore, the limited partnership does not pay taxes on its income like a corporation does. Rather, both the income of the partnership and the tax owed on that income is allocated to the limited partners (i.e. the unit holders)", "poration does. Rather, both the income of the partnership and the tax owed on that income is allocated to the limited partners (i.e. the unit holders). The unit holders receive the income generated by the limited partnership in its original form and then must report the income in their tax filings as originally allocated to them, for example as: \u2022 interest \u2022 dividends \u2022 capital gains The unit holders are required to include the income allocated to them in their tax filings regardless if the income was distributed to them in cash or it was retained by the partnership for use in the business. Unlike investors of other securities (for example mutual funds or exchange-traded funds), the losses incurred by a limited partnership are also allocated to the limited partners. These capital losses can also be claimed by the limited partners (i.e. unit holders) in their tax filings subject to normal conditions. For example, capital losses can only be offset against taxable capital gains; they cannot be deducted from income", "ilings subject to normal conditions. For example, capital losses can only be offset against taxable capital gains; they cannot be deducted from income. AT-RISK RULES The at-risk rules in the Income Tax Act (Canada) limit the amount of a capital loss that a limited partner can claim to the amount of the limited partner\u2019s at-risk amount. Therefore, a limited partner\u2019s loss cannot exceed the amount that the limited partner stands to lose and the adjusted cost base (ACB) of the investment cannot be reduced below zero dollars. EXAMPLE Adam invests $30,000 in the ResGem Limited Partnership and earns $5,000 in income from the partnership, for an adjusted cost base (ACB) of $35,000 ($30,000 + $5,000). The partnership loses $1,000,000 of which $45,000 is allocated to Adam. However, the maximum loss that Adam can claim is $35,000, the at-risk amount of his investment. After Adam claims the losses, the ACB of Adam\u2019s investment is $0 ($35,000 \u2212 $35,000). Losses in the example above of $10,000 could not be claimed since the at-risk rules prevent the ACB of an investment to be reduced below zero dollars", "Losses in the example above of $10,000 could not be claimed since the at-risk rules prevent the ACB of an investment to be reduced below zero dollars. A limited partner\u2019s share of any loss denied as a consequence of the application of the at-risk rules is considered to be a limited partnership loss in respect of the limited partnership for the year. The limited partner may deduct the limited partnership loss in future years, provided certain conditions are satisfied. FLOW-THROUGH TAX TREATMENT Unit holders can further benefit from a tax perspective where the business of the limited partnership is one which benefits from favorable government policy and tax treatment. For example, in order to encourage investment in the exploration and development of natural resources including oil and gas, mining, and renewable energy, the federal government has designated certain companies as principal-business corporations (PBCs). These PBCs are permitted to issue flow-through shares/units which confer substantial tax benefits to their initial investors (unit holders)", "ns (PBCs). These PBCs are permitted to issue flow-through shares/units which confer substantial tax benefits to their initial investors (unit holders). The LESSON 2 LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS 6 \u2022 21 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE companies flow-through or \u201crenounce\u201d to the unit holders, the expenses which they would otherwise be entitled to. In turn, the unit holders deduct the expenses from their other sources of income, thereby reducing their income taxes payable. EXAMPLE Jim subscribes for flow-through shares of a resource company in the amount of $100,000. The company uses the subscription proceeds on exploration and development expenses amounting to $100,000 and renounces the expenses to Jim. Jim deducts the renounced expenses of $100,000 as exploration and development expenses in computing his taxable income. Suppose Jim pays tax at a marginal rate of 46%. The tax saving is $46,000 or ($100,000 \u00d7 46%). RENOUNCEABLE EXPENSES A PBC may renounce the following types of expenses to unit holders: \u2022 Canadian exploration expense (CEE) \u2022 Canadian development expense (CDE) Overhead expenses which are included in CEE or CDE may not be renounced to unit holders", "exploration expense (CEE) \u2022 Canadian development expense (CDE) Overhead expenses which are included in CEE or CDE may not be renounced to unit holders. When CEE and CDE are renounced to unit holders, they are added to the unit holder\u2019s respective cumulative CEE pool and cumulative CDE pool. The difference between the two pools lies in the percentage of the annual deduction. A taxpayer may deduct up to 100% of the balance in his or her cumulative CEE pool in a year. In the case of the cumulative CDE pool, the maximum percentage deductible in a year is 30%. Any balance not deducted may be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in future years. INVESTING IN FLOW-THROUGH SHARES Investors may invest in flow-through shares in two different ways: \u2022 directly by purchasing the shares from a PBC \u2022 indirectly by purchasing units in a limited partnership that purchases flow-through shares from a number of PBCs Investing directly in flow-through shares of a PBC exposes the investor to the risks inherent in investing in a single issuer in a cyclical industry. Therefore, most individuals invest in flow-through shares indirectly by purchasing units of a limited partnership", "ingle issuer in a cyclical industry. Therefore, most individuals invest in flow-through shares indirectly by purchasing units of a limited partnership. A flow-through limited partnership is a professionally managed portfolio which pools the money of many investors and invests in a diversified portfolio of flow-through shares. Some flow-through limited partnerships are publicly distributed whereas others are distributed by way of a private placement, usually under the offering memorandum exemption. The manager of a flow-through limited partnership is usually entitled to a management fee which may be expressed as an annual percentage of the net asset value of the limited partnership. The manager may also be entitled to a performance bonus which may be expressed as a percentage of the amount by which the cumulative performance of the limited partnership throughout its term exceeds a specified threshold. TAX-EXEMPT INVESTORS The structure of limited partnerships is particularly beneficial to tax-exempt investors such as pension funds. Suppose a pension fund invests in a company", "tructure of limited partnerships is particularly beneficial to tax-exempt investors such as pension funds. Suppose a pension fund invests in a company. Although the pension fund is a tax-exempt entity, it pays tax indirectly because the company pays corporate tax before distributing earnings to shareholders as dividends. However, there is no entity level taxed on income for a limited partnership. The pension fund\u2019s share of the limited EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 66 \u2022 22 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE partnership\u2019s pre-tax profits is allocated to the pension fund. Since the pension fund is exempt from paying taxes, the pension fund avoids tax on the profits altogether. FORM T5013 PARTNERSHIP INFORMATION RETURN Although limited partnerships generally are not subject to tax, they must file Form T5013 (Partnership Information Return) with the CRA for each fiscal period and at other times during the fiscal period where certain conditions are met. Form T5013 (Partnership Information Return) and the related schedules essentially provide the CRA with information about the limited partnership\u2019s income or loss and the share of income or loss allocated to each limited partner", "ally provide the CRA with information about the limited partnership\u2019s income or loss and the share of income or loss allocated to each limited partner.

ADJUSTED COST BASE (ACB) OF A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP UNIT When a limited partner sells their limited partnership units, the capital gain or loss must be considered for tax purposes. The amount of the capital gain is the difference between the proceeds of disposition and the total of: \u2022 the adjusted cost base (ACB) of the units; and \u2022 the expenses incurred to dispose of the units", "between the proceeds of disposition and the total of: \u2022 the adjusted cost base (ACB) of the units; and \u2022 the expenses incurred to dispose of the units. LESSON 2 LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS 6 \u2022 23 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE In order to determine the adjusted cost base (ACB) of the limited partnership units, a calculation is performed as follows: Formula: Adjusted-Cost Base (A + B) \u2212 (C + D) = E Where: A = the subscription price paid for the unit B = income allocated to the limited partner C = losses, investment tax credits, and resource deductions allocated to the limited partner D = cash distributions made to the limited partner E = Adjusted-Cost Base of the units If the ACB is less than zero (for instance if the limited partnership makes a large distribution), the negative amount of the ACB is deemed to be a capital gain. \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE 3Trusts CONTENT AREAS What is a Business Trust?

The details of the trust are determined by the contracting parties in the agreement governing the trust", "there is no legislation in Canada for trusts. The details of the trust are determined by the contracting parties in the agreement governing the trust. CREATION OF A TRUST The three certainties that establish a trust are: \u2022 Certainty of intention: the settlor must intend to create a trust \u2022 Certainty of subject matter: the specific trust property must be ascertainable \u2022 Certainty of objects: the beneficiaries must be ascertainable The Declaration of Trust or Trust Agreement between the trustee and the settlor establishes the trust and describes the \u201cterms of the trust\u201d: the specific contractual requirements for carrying out the purpose of the trust.

In the context of a business trust, the trustee is the manager of the business for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust. The trustee can delegate some or all of its responsibilities to a manager and others by contract", "ss for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust. The trustee can delegate some or all of its responsibilities to a manager and others by contract. Notwithstanding delegation, a trustee remains legally responsible to the beneficiaries. Unlike a corporation, a trust is not a separate legal entity. Consequently, a trust does not have the power to hold title to property. The trustee of the trust is the legal person who has the power to hold title to trust property and enter into contracts. Likewise, there is no limitation of liability for trustees. While trustees are entitled to indemnification in certain circumstances, they may incur substantial liabilities under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and they can be held liable to beneficiaries for breaches of trust. A breach of trust occurs if a trustee violates any duty that they owe as trustees to the beneficiaries. One example would be investing in securities that were not a proper investment for the trust. It is important to note that this is not the same as making an underperforming investment choice", "ties that were not a proper investment for the trust. It is important to note that this is not the same as making an underperforming investment choice. Instead, it would cover investments that should never be included in a trust\u2019s portfolio, for example currency futures in a real estate investment trust (REIT). An individual or a corporation can act as trustee. A trust can also have more than one trustee. Where there are multiple trustees, the collective body of trustees is often referred to as a board of trustees. BENEFICIARIES The beneficiaries of a trust are those persons who hold the beneficial or equitable interest in the trust property. The trust is administered by the trustee for the benefit of the beneficiaries. In the context of a business trust, the beneficiaries have an interest in the business, similar to the interests of the shareholders of a corporation and the limited partners of a limited partnership. From the perspective of investing, the beneficiaries are the unit holders of the trust.

ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS TRUST Business trusts have become a popular investment structure, which may be attributable to the advantages of holding assets in business trusts, such as: \u2022 separation of equitable and legal ownership \u2014 the existence of a separate \u201cequitable\u201d ownership for the beneficiaries allows for an investor interest in the business legally owned by the trustee and managed for the investors\u2019 benefit \u2022 fiduciary duty \u2014 subjecting the trustee to a fiduciary duty ensures an alignment of interest between the trustee and the investors and creates a powerful safeguard against abuse \u2022 relative absence of mandatory statutory law \u2014 fewer mandatory statutory requirements means the creators of the trust have a relatively free hand to achieve business objectives \u2022 flexibility in design \u2014 since the trust is governed by contract, a trust can be shaped precisely as the creators intend \u2022 insolvency protection \u2014 trust property is often beyond the reach of creditors of the beneficiaries in insolvency situations, and trust property may", "\u2022 insolvency protection \u2014 trust property is often beyond the reach of creditors of the beneficiaries in insolvency situations, and trust property may be beyond the reach of unsecured creditors of the trustee in the event of insolvency \u2022 advantageous tax planning \u2014 trusts can be used as flow-through vehicles for tax purposes and also allow flexible allocation of income and losses MUTUAL FUND TRUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF A BUSINESS TRUST One of the more common forms of business trusts are mutual fund trusts. A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment portfolio that pools money from many investors in order to invest collectively in a pool of securities, such as equities, bonds, and money market instruments. A mutual fund trust is established by an agreement between the trustee and the party establishing the fund (the settlor or \u201csponsor\u201d of the mutual fund). Investors purchase units in the fund. The unitholders of the mutual fund trust are the beneficiaries. In the case of a mutual fund trust, several functions are required to be performed by persons who are registered under applicable securities legislation", "the case of a mutual fund trust, several functions are required to be performed by persons who are registered under applicable securities legislation. A registered portfolio manager is required to perform the investment management function and a registered investment fund manager is required to administer the business and affairs of the fund. Therefore, the Declaration of Trust will delegate these duties to the portfolio manager and investment fund manager. For a mutual fund trust, the portfolio manager and investment fund manager assume the critical functions necessary for the operation of the mutual fund trust. The trustee retains ultimate legal responsibility and liability for all the delegated functions and has a duty to monitor the performance of the portfolio manager and investment fund manager. LIABILITY OF BENEFICIARIES While the shareholders in corporations and the unit holders of limited partnerships have limited liability, there is no corresponding statutory limitation on liability in the case of the beneficiary of a trust. Liabilities could include those arising from claims of negligence or in respect of taxes", "ation on liability in the case of the beneficiary of a trust. Liabilities could include those arising from claims of negligence or in respect of taxes. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 66 \u2022 32 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE In 2004, Ontario enacted legislation to create limited liability for the beneficiaries of certain trusts. The Trust Beneficiaries\u2019 Liability Act, 2004 (Ontario) provides that the unitholders of a trust are not liable for any act, default, obligation, or liability of the trust or any of its trustees if, when the liability arises, the trust is: \u2022 a reporting issuer under the Securities Act (Ontario) \u2022 governed by Ontario laws The legislation, however, does not address the liability of beneficiaries of non-public trusts. TAX CONSIDERATIONS The tax considerations of any investment should be determined in consultation with a professional tax adviser. For information purposes, the general tax considerations in relation to trust units are outlined below. ALLOCATION OF INCOME AND TAXES The Income Tax Act (Canada) treats a trust as a separate taxpayer for income tax purposes", "ust units are outlined below. ALLOCATION OF INCOME AND TAXES The Income Tax Act (Canada) treats a trust as a separate taxpayer for income tax purposes. This means that any income earned by the trust, after management fees and expenses, will be taxed in the trust, separate from the beneficiaries. Where the trust distributes income to the beneficiaries, the income is taxed to the beneficiaries. The Income Tax Act (Canada) contains provisions which permit flow-through tax treatment of income earned by a trust subject to certain conditions. Income that is earned through a trust and then paid to the beneficiaries (i.e. unit holders) is taxed at only one level, to the beneficiaries. Income earned by the trust and retained by the trust is taxed to the trust. The beneficiaries (unit holders) receive the income generated by the trust in its original form and then must report the income in their tax filings as originally allocated to them, for example as: \u2022 interest \u2022 dividends \u2022 capital gains SIFT RULES The trust structure has greater tax efficiency since there is no tax at the entity level, unlike corporations which pay taxes on their earnings", "RULES The trust structure has greater tax efficiency since there is no tax at the entity level, unlike corporations which pay taxes on their earnings. For trusts, income is flowed to unit holders, unlike the shareholders of corporations who receive after-tax income net of corporate taxes. As such, many large public companies previously operating as corporations began to convert into income trusts in the late 1990s. The trend gained momentum after 2000 and the federal government became worried about the potential erosion of tax revenues. In order to address the tax revenue issues, the federal government introduced the Specified Investment Flow-Through (SIFT) rules. The main purpose of the SIFT rules is to tax certain amounts earned by publicly-traded income trusts and limited partnerships. The SIFT rules addressed the tax issues that were prevalent for income trusts and limited partnerships prior to 2006. Income from a business, which previously escaped entity level tax prior to 2006, is now subject to tax. Tax-exempt investors, such as pension funds, receive distributions from income trusts after-tax similar to corporations, thus eliminating the previous tax advantages", "stors, such as pension funds, receive distributions from income trusts after-tax similar to corporations, thus eliminating the previous tax advantages. \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE 4 CONTENT AREAS A Fund is not an Investment Structure What is a Fund?

Public investment funds include: \u2022 mutual funds \u2022 non-redeemable investment funds \u2022 commodity pools MUTUAL FUNDS Mutual funds are the most common type of public investment fund, attracting the highest assets world-wide in investment funds. The defining characteristics of mutual funds are summarized below. \u2022 Redeemable: Mutual funds are redeemable, meaning that the unit holders are entitled to redeem units, on demand, and receive a proportionate amount for their units based on the current net asset value (NAV)", "he unit holders are entitled to redeem units, on demand, and receive a proportionate amount for their units based on the current net asset value (NAV). \u2022 Net asset value (NAV): Mutual funds follow a strict valuation regimen which allows them to determine the value for their net assets in the portfolio (in most cases on a daily basis) and then determine the NAV per unit. The NAV per unit is published in financial publications/media. \u2022 Open-ended: Mutual funds are \u201copen-ended\u201d and they continuously issue and redeem units, so the number of units outstanding varies from day to day.

The tax treatment of the mutual fund will depend on whether the mutual fund is structured as a corporation or a trust. NON-REDEEMABLE INVESTMENT FUNDS A non-redeemable investment fund is one that has a primary purpose to invest the pooled money from its investors into a diversified portfolio, but is not: \u2022 a mutual fund; and is not an issuer that: \u2022 invests for the purpose of control over another issuer it invests in; or \u2022 invests for the purpose of being actively involved in the management of the issuer it invests in. A public non-redeemable investment fund is that of a reporting issuer which is offered by prospectus and is subject to NI 81-102 and NI 81-106. Non-redeemable investment funds do not have the NAV and redemption features of a mutual fund. Absent the necessity to provide for liquidity in order to fund redemptions, non-redeemable investment funds have the flexibility to invest in assets with limited liquidity. The securities of non-redeemable investment funds typically are traded on a stock exchange. Selling on the public market is the primary liquidity option for an investor in securities of a non-redeemable investment fund", "ed on a stock exchange. Selling on the public market is the primary liquidity option for an investor in securities of a non-redeemable investment fund. Non-redeemable investment funds include: \u2022 closed-end funds \u2022 exchange-traded funds \u2022 flow-through limited partnerships CLOSED-END FUNDS Closed-end funds are diversified portfolios where a fixed number of shares of the portfolio are issued. Closed-end funds do not have a redemption feature and most commonly the shares of closed-end funds trade on a listed exchange in the same manner as listed common shares. Closed-end funds generally trade at a discount to the NAV of its investment portfolio. The discount essentially reflects a market adjustment to reflect the costs of the fund including management fees. Unlike mutual funds, closed-end funds have no limits on short selling. EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are \u201copen-ended\u201d investment funds that trade on listed exchanges. As such, ETFs are generally highly liquid. ETFs invest in diversified portfolios, most commonly with the purpose of replicating a stock index or other financial benchmark or market sector", "quid. ETFs invest in diversified portfolios, most commonly with the purpose of replicating a stock index or other financial benchmark or market sector. The securities of ETFs are redeemable, but the redemption amount is not a proportionate share of NAV which makes them different and unique from mutual funds. The redemption price for an ETF is set relative to another benchmark (typically a fixed percentage discount of the closing price of the ETF\u2019s securities on the exchange). Accordingly, ETFs are not mutual funds and are considered non-redeemable for the purposes of securities legislation. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs can use derivatives and alternative investment strategies to replicate the index that they follow.

ETFs use derivatives, alternative investment strategies, and leverage in order to achieve the desired inverse/leveraged results. FLOW-THROUGH LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS Flow-through limited partnerships are diversified investment funds which invest in tax-advantaged investments and provide the investors of the fund with tax incentives from the flow-through of tax benefits through the limited partnership. One of the primary reasons investors purchase securities issued by flow-through limited partnerships is to receive the tax benefits. The tax benefits from a flow-through limited partnership accrue to the original investor and are not continuous. As such, securities of flow-through limited partnerships do not generally trade on an exchange, although some do. The securities of the limited partnership are also not redeemable. After the tax benefits have been allocated to investors, the flow-through limited partnership units are most commonly converted to a conventional public mutual fund at which point there may be a liquidity facility for the investors", "partnership units are most commonly converted to a conventional public mutual fund at which point there may be a liquidity facility for the investors. COMMODITY POOLS Commodity pools are a special sub-set of public investment funds which focus on investing in commodities in a way that is not permitted under the investment restrictions in NI 81-102. Rather, commodity pools are subject to the regulations in National Instrument 81-104 Commodity Pools (NI 81-104). NON-PUBLIC INVESTMENT FUNDS A non-public investment fund is a fund that is not a reporting issuer. Non-public investment funds distribute their securities under an exemption from prospectus requirements in the exempt market. Non-public investment funds are not subject to the regulations established in NI 81-101 or NI 81-102, including the restrictions with respect to concentration, control, types of investments, and leverage.

The pooled fund offers a convenient and efficient way to allocate client participation in securities transactions. Commonly, exempt market dealers (EMDs) cannot participate in pooled funds since the securities of the pooled fund are not offered outside the portfolio manager\u2019s existing pool of clients. In some circumstances, a portfolio manager will open up their pooled fund to investors outside of their managed account clients and an EMD could participate in that distribution", "rtfolio manager will open up their pooled fund to investors outside of their managed account clients and an EMD could participate in that distribution.

RISKS OF NON-PUBLIC MUTUAL FUNDS There are certain risks you must be aware of with respect to non-public mutual funds. For example, the redemption rights associated with a private mutual fund may be drawn out over a longer period of time than is typical for a public mutual fund. Absent the protections provided under securities legislation for mutual funds offered by prospectus, there are risks associated with non-public mutual funds that you should make your clients aware of. NON-PUBLIC NON-REDEEMABLE INVESTMENT FUNDS Non-redeemable investment funds are typically issued by reporting issuers, such as closed-end funds and ETFs, and the securities are listed and traded on exchanges.

This provides liquidity and compensates for the exclusion of a redemption feature. In the case of a non-public non-redeemable investment fund, the investors must be prepared to endure an illiquid investment until a liquidity event is achieved (such as the wind-up of the fund at a set future time). The most common type of non-public non-redeemable investment funds are hedge funds which are structured as limited partnerships. HEDGE FUNDS Hedge funds are investment funds which invest in a portfolio of assets and units are issued to investors by way of offering memorandum. Unlike mutual funds, the objective of hedge funds is to achieve absolute returns under all market conditions, whether markets are up or down. Hedge funds are sometimes referred to as \u201cmarket neutral\u201d to describe this objective. In order to achieve absolute returns, hedge funds use derivatives and alternative investment strategies including short selling, leverage, concentrated positions, and arbitrage transactions", "edge funds use derivatives and alternative investment strategies including short selling, leverage, concentrated positions, and arbitrage transactions.

WHAT ARE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES? Similar to investment funds, asset-backed securities are diverse portfolios of assets which are sold to investors as securities; each security represents a piece of the portfolio. Unlike investment funds, asset-backed securities invest in pools of assets which are receivables including: \u2022 mortgages \u2022 car loan receivables \u2022 credit card receivables \u2022 consumer loans \u2022 corporate/sovereign loans \u2022 home equity loans \u2022 lease/trade receivables Similar to investments funds, an asset-backed security is not an investment structure in the sense that it is not a separate legal form. From the perspective of investment structure, an asset-backed security is structured as a trust. HOW ASSETS ARE SECURITIZED? 1. The securitization of assets begins with the \u201coriginator\u201d, the financial institution with the assets (for example mortgages). The originator creates the pool of assets and sells them to a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d (SPV), the entity (issuer) which is usually set up by the financial institution. 2", "es the pool of assets and sells them to a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d (SPV), the entity (issuer) which is usually set up by the financial institution. 2. The SPV issuer finances the acquisition of the assets by raising the funds in the capital market by issuing securities. 3. Investors purchase the asset-backed securities.

CR Car Leasing Inc. decides to sell some of its receivables in order to raise the capital", "y is already near limits with respect to its debt-to-equity. CR Car Leasing Inc. decides to sell some of its receivables in order to raise the capital. While there is no market for car leases, CR Car Leasing can pool the leases and sell the pool to an issuer. The issuer converts the pool of receivables leases into a tradable security and CR Car Leasing is able to raise the capital that it needs.

In essence, the debt payments that the borrowers make on their mortgages, loans, etc. are flowed through to the investors of the asset-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are a common form of asset- backed security. When assets are \u201csecuritized\u201d, they are converted from non-tradable assets into tradable securities. The securitization of the underlying assets enables the lending institutions who own the receivables to transfer some of the risks of ownership to the investors of the asset-backed securities. The more common risks associated with asset-backed securities include: \u2022 Credit risk: the risk of loss arising from defaults (failure to repay) within the pool of assets \u2022 Prepayment risk: the risk of loss arising from pre-payments (before maturity) which result in lower interest payments to the trust The assets in the underlying pool are held in trust as collateral for the asset-backed securities", "which result in lower interest payments to the trust The assets in the underlying pool are held in trust as collateral for the asset-backed securities. Commonly, credit enhancement will be used in order to improve the credit worthiness of the asset-backed security by way of senior/ subordinated structures (i.e. tranches), additional collateral, increased cash reserves, insurance, or other means. Asset-backed securities are offered through both the public and private markets. Asset-backed securities that are distributed in the private market are offered under the short-term securitized product exemption and must satisfy the criteria below", "curities that are distributed in the private market are offered under the short-term securitized product exemption and must satisfy the criteria below. To be eligible for exemption, the asset-backed security must: \u2022 have high credit ratings, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 (NI 45-106), assigned by at least 2 designated ratings organizations (DROs) \u2022 not have any credit ratings below a certain level, as defined in NI 45-106, assigned by any DRO \u2022 have principal and interest obligations guaranteed by an approved \u201cliquidity provider\u201d \u2022 be offered under an Information Memorandum in the prescribed form (Form 45-106F7) \u2022 provide Monthly Disclosure Reports in the prescribed form (Form 45-106F8) \u2022 provide certain disclosure for material changes, changes in credit ratings, defaults, etc. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 66 \u2022 50 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE The minimum denomination for an investment in an asset-backed security is typically $1,000, although some classes have higher minimum denominations.

While some asset-backed securities are available to retail investors, the main market for asset-backed securities is institutional investors. Typically, most institutions do not make investments in asset-backed securities of less than $1 million. The price of an asset-backed security will depend on the interest rate and the yield to maturity at the time the asset-backed security is traded. How quickly and easily a given asset-backed security can be sold determines its marketability. In general, for an asset-backed security to enjoy high marketability, there must be a significant trading volume and a large number of dealers in the security.

WHAT IS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST? A real estate investment trust (REIT) is an investment vehicle that invests in income-producing commercial real estate properties like office buildings and shopping malls, or residential apartment buildings. The managers of the REIT raise capital by issuing units in a trust. In return for their investment, unit holders receive regular monthly or quarterly cash distributions, with the potential for capital appreciation if the underlying properties increase in value", "rs receive regular monthly or quarterly cash distributions, with the potential for capital appreciation if the underlying properties increase in value. The income received by the REIT, which is then passed along to its investors, is primarily rental or leasing income from its tenants. A REIT in the United States (U.S.) is a corporation or business trust that is permitted to flow its income through to its shareholders without any corporate income tax. To qualify as a REIT, a corporation or trust must pay out almost all of its taxable income to its shareholders. It must also meet conditions limiting the nature of its assets and business activities. If it does, the U.S. REIT does not pay federal taxes on its income, which avoids the double taxation of regular corporations. THE HISTORY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS IN CANADA In the early 1990s, open-end mutual funds that invested specifically in real estate existed in Canada. The Tax Act (Canada) at that time did not permit real property as an eligible investment for a closed-end investment trust, so real estate investment funds were structured as open-end funds", "ot permit real property as an eligible investment for a closed-end investment trust, so real estate investment funds were structured as open-end funds. However, real estate investments, being illiquid assets, proved to be inappropriate investments for open-end mutual funds requiring liquidity for redemptions. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the collapse in the real estate market resulted in a surge of redemptions from real estate mutual funds and the funds struggled to meet redemptions. The mutual funds also experienced valuation issues because the underlying properties in the funds were based on out-of-date appraisal values. As a result, the mutual funds paid out more on their redemptions than the NAV of the funds. The mutual funds turned to the securities commissions for approval to suspend payments and restructure the funds. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 77 \u2022 4 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE Changes to the Tax Act in 1994 made it possible for real property to be the capital property of a trust, paving the way for the establishment of REITs as closed-end trusts", "t in 1994 made it possible for real property to be the capital property of a trust, paving the way for the establishment of REITs as closed-end trusts. Unlike open-end funds, closed-end funds issue a set number of shares which are traded on a listed exchange, thus relieving the issuer from redemption obligations and liquidity constraints. In the 2000s, open-end REITs re-emerged with modified redemption features. The new generation of REITs offer modified redemptions that satisfy the requirements of an open-end trust as defined under the Tax Act. The REITs may still be traded on a stock exchange, but the unit holders also have the right to redeem their units through the trust itself, subject to restrictions: \u2022 The redemption price may be less than the current market price \u2022 It may not be payable immediately in cash \u2022 There may be a limit on how much the fund will pay to unit holders at a given time \u2022 In certain circumstances, the right of redemption may be suspended THE STRUCTURE OF REIT s REITs are diversified portfolios which are structured as trusts. The money pooled from the unit holders is used to purchase real property through a nominee corporation", "fied portfolios which are structured as trusts. The money pooled from the unit holders is used to purchase real property through a nominee corporation. Rental income is paid by the tenants of the real property and is flowed through to the unit holders. The nominee corporation is used to facilitate the process from both an administrative and taxation point of view. The diagram below illustrates the structure of a REIT.

The nominee corporation owns legal title to the real property. The REIT\u2019s trustees are beneficiaries of the property held by the nominee corporation. The use of a nominee corporation means the trustees do not have to sign any contracts themselves. If they did, it might put them in a position to be personally liable for any obligations of the REIT", "ees do not have to sign any contracts themselves. If they did, it might put them in a position to be personally liable for any obligations of the REIT. OPERATING COMPANY Under the Tax Act, a REIT may not carry on as a business or it will lose its favorable tax status as a mutual fund trust. However, a REIT may have a subsidiary company, such as a property management company, to carry out the business activities of the properties including rent collection, maintenance, etc. PROPERTY MANAGER The property manager may be external or internal to the REIT. The importance of the property manager should not be underestimated. The property manager needs to make sure that properties have sufficient occupancy to maintain rental/lease payments to the REIT and that rental payments are collected properly. If the property manager cannot transfer enough rental income to the REIT, distributions to unit holders may be either suspended or reduced. SUBSIDIARY REIT s Some REITs will hold units of another REIT or a diversified portfolio of REITs that it can adjust as market conditions change. PORTFOLIO MANAGER Normally, the trustees of a REIT delegate the portfolio management function to a manager", "it can adjust as market conditions change. PORTFOLIO MANAGER Normally, the trustees of a REIT delegate the portfolio management function to a manager. The manager provides the following services: \u2022 management of the REIT\u2019s property portfolio \u2022 strategic advice on property investments, financing, and operating policies \u2022 administrative functions \u2022 dealings with financial institutions \u2022 accounting functions \u2022 investor relations REITs may engage an external third-party manager under an external management arrangement. However, external management fees can be prohibitive and may include management fees, fees for acquisitions, a percentage of gains on dispositions, fees for development and financing, and incentive fees for achieving certain thresholds. The trend has been to use internal managers rather than external managers and most established Canadian REITs now have the ability to run their own management team in-house. The management team is employed by the REIT or one of its operating entities. Internal managers are usually paid with a combination of salary, bonus, and other incentive plans including unit option plans", "its operating entities. Internal managers are usually paid with a combination of salary, bonus, and other incentive plans including unit option plans. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 77 \u2022 6 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE CHARACTERISTICS OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS INVESTMENTS REITs are designed to provide a regular stream of distributions to its unit holders. To maintain these payments, REITs invest primarily in a diversified portfolio of income producing properties. Commonly, the Declaration of Trust for most REITs establishes certain restrictions including: \u2022 concentration limits: which prevent the REIT from investing a certain percentage of the portfolio in any one property \u2022 limits on undeveloped land: usually limited to a small percentage, subject to conditions requiring that the investment is related to renovation, expansion, or development of an income producing property \u2022 mortgage limits: usually limited to a small percentage (e.g. 20% of unit holder equity or 15% of book value), subject to conditions including: \u2022 the requirement that the underlying property is income producing \u2022 the maximum loan-to-value ratio (e.g", "ook value), subject to conditions including: \u2022 the requirement that the underlying property is income producing \u2022 the maximum loan-to-value ratio (e.g. 75%) \u2022 the debt service coverage ratio (e.g. 1.2 times, or 20% more than mortgage interest) Other matters specific to REITs covered in the Declaration of Trust include: \u2022 lease/sublease restrictions: restricting the lease or sublease of property to any person where that property\u2019s fair market value is greater than a certain percentage of the REIT\u2019s unitholders\u2019 equity or book value \u2022 indebtedness: commonly prohibited from incurring debt totaling more than a certain percentage of the gross book value of the REIT\u2019s assets (e.g. 40% - 70%) and limits on debt incurred at floating rates, short-term debt, or the REITs ability to guarantee loans, etc. \u2022 property insurance coverage: the parameters related to adequate property insurance coverage \u2022 independent appraisals: the requirement to obtain independent property appraisals \u2022 environmental audit: the requirement to obtain independent environmental audits It is important to note that these investment restrictions and other limits are not mandated by securities or tax legislation", "ent environmental audits It is important to note that these investment restrictions and other limits are not mandated by securities or tax legislation. You must examine the REITs Declaration of Trust thoroughly as a matter of your due diligence obligations. TYPES OF REIT s REITs in Canada generally invest in the following types of real estate: \u2022 nursing homes \u2022 hotel properties \u2022 shopping malls \u2022 self-storage facilities \u2022 industrial facilities \u2022 apartments \u2022 industrial and office buildings Some REITs will hold different types of real estate investments in an effort to diversify across real estate type. Others will be more narrowly focused on one or two areas but diversify geographically by investing in different real estate markets. Others again will be even more narrowly diversified in one sector in one region. LESSON 1 REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS 7 \u2022 7 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXAMPLE Boardwalk REIT owns and operates residential multi-family revenue producing properties.

EXAMPLE Chartwell Retirement Residences REIT is focused exclusively on owning and managing a variety of seniors housing communities in Canada and the U.S. EXAMPLE Calloway Investment Trust REIT concentrates almost exclusively on shopping centers across Canada. TRADING PUBLIC REIT s Publicly traded REITs are bought and sold on stock exchanges in a similar fashion as shares of public corporations. Unit holders of REITs of a publicly traded open-end trust may also redeem their units with the REIT itself, subject to restrictions. REDEMPTIONS While REITs structured as open-end trusts must provide a redemption feature in order to qualify under the Tax Act, the redemption of REIT units may be subject to certain conditions. Some of the common redemption restrictions are summarized in the table below. Redemption Restrictions Discounted Redemption Price \u2022 the redemption price offered by the REIT is less than the current market price (e.g", "table below.

As with all other exempt securities, there is no secondary market for private REITs and there are usually resale restrictions", "liquid as public REITs. As with all other exempt securities, there is no secondary market for private REITs and there are usually resale restrictions. Therefore, the only option available to unit holders would be EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 77 \u2022 8 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE to redeem the units through the issuer, subject to the REIT\u2019s redemption restrictions. The redemption price for units of private REITs is largely based on the value of the underlying properties, which is determined by an independent appraisal. YIELD Units of a REIT trade primarily on the basis of their yield. The most common performance measurement for REITs that investors look at is yield. The yield is calculated by dividing the annual cash distributions by the current market price and is expressed as a percentage. Annual distribution ($)yield Market price ($)= Investors compare REIT yields to those of other investments like fixed income products and equities. Yields are a rough guide to the quality of a REIT and should not be looked at in isolation", "other investments like fixed income products and equities.

It may be useful over a one- or two-year period, but the longer the period in question, the more inaccurate total return calculations become. More accurate measurements incorporate the time value of money.

PRIVATE REIT s Private REITs are offered in the exempt market. The structure of a private REIT is very similar to a public REIT, the main difference being that they do not trade on a stock exchange and they must be structured as an open-end unit trust. The units of a private REIT must be bought and redeemed directly from the REIT issuer, there is no secondary market", "uctured as an open-end unit trust. The units of a private REIT must be bought and redeemed directly from the REIT issuer, there is no secondary market. As with all securities offered in the exempt market, private REITs are distributed primarily by way of an offering memorandum (OM) and may only be purchased by certain investors who qualify for exemption (e.g. accredited investor exemption, eligible investor under the offering memorandum exemption, etc.). You should thoroughly review the offering documents (offering memorandum) as a matter of your due diligence obligations. TAX CONSIDERATIONS The tax considerations of any investment should be determined in consultation with a professional tax adviser.

For example, capital gains earned by the REIT are flowed through to the unit holders as capital gains. The unit holder will receive form T3 (Statement of Trust Allocations and Designations) and form T5 from the REIT which will report the capital gains, dividends, income, and taxable amounts to the unit holder. The unit holders must report the income received by the REIT and reported on the T3 and T5 forms in their tax filings for that year", "o the unit holder. The unit holders must report the income received by the REIT and reported on the T3 and T5 forms in their tax filings for that year. The tax treatment of unit holders\u2019 REIT income is summarized in the table below.

Normally, a REIT\u2019s declaration of trust will stipulate that the maximum CCA be deducted in a year to reduce or eliminate its taxable income. However, CCA is not deducted when computing a REIT\u2019s distributable income (DI). The result is that usually, a REIT\u2019s DI will be larger than its taxable income, meaning a portion of a distribution made to a unit holder will consist of income that was not taxable to the REIT", "l be larger than its taxable income, meaning a portion of a distribution made to a unit holder will consist of income that was not taxable to the REIT. Part of the unit holder\u2019s distribution is thus tax-sheltered by CCA in the year it is received. This part of a unit holder\u2019s distribution is treated as a return of capital. The portion of a distribution allocated to return of capital is usually about 75% - 85%. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 77 \u2022 12 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE TAX TREATMENT OF A RETURN OF CAPITAL A return of capital is not taxable to the unit holder in the year it is received. Instead, his or her adjusted cost base (ACB) is reduced by the amount of the return of capital. EXAMPLE Grace owns 100 units of HiRize REIT for which she paid $15 per unit at the beginning of this year. She receives a distribution of $1 per unit, 20% is income from property and 80% is a return of capital. From the distribution, she must include $20 in her taxable income, or ($0.20 \u00d7 100). She will not pay tax this year on the $0.80 per unit allocated to return of capital. Instead, she will reduce her ACB per unit by $0.80 per unit to $14.20", "will not pay tax this year on the $0.80 per unit allocated to return of capital. Instead, she will reduce her ACB per unit by $0.80 per unit to $14.20. Income is taxed in full in the year it is received, whereas tax on a return of capital is deferred until the year the units are sold and is taxed at the lower capital gains tax rate. By postponing the payment of tax on the return of capital, the REIT provides some tax deferral and as a capital gain, it is only taxed at 50% of the gain. ADJUSTED COST BASE A unit holder\u2019s adjusted cost base (ACB) at the time of disposition must capture the return of capital distributions paid to the unit holder. A return of capital distribution is not taxable when it is paid to the investor. However, a capital gain (or loss) will be realized when the investor eventually redeems the units. The capital gain will be greater (or the capital loss smaller) when a return of capital has been paid because the adjusted cost base was reduced. EXAMPLE: RETURN OF CAPITAL (CASH DISTRIBUTION) Sammah purchased units of CanMall REIT at two intervals last year: 1,000 units for $12/unit in January and 500 units for $12.50/unit in March", "IBUTION) Sammah purchased units of CanMall REIT at two intervals last year: 1,000 units for $12/unit in January and 500 units for $12.50/unit in March. At the end of the year, the REIT made a distribution of $1.00 and $.60 per unit was a return of capital. Sammah took the distribution as cash. On June 30 of this year, she sold 500 units of her REIT.

The ACB of the remaining holdings is the difference between the ACB of 1,500 units less the ACB of the units sold or ($17 ,350 \u2212 $5,785) = $11,565.

EFFECT OF A DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (DRIP) If the unit holder is a member of a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP), the full amount of the distribution is used to purchase more units of the REIT. A purchase of more units will also change the ACB of the investment.

SIFT RULES In October, 2006, the federal government introduced the Specified Investment Flow-Through (SIFT) rules which established significant changes to the tax treatment of income trusts. The SIFT rules eliminated the tax advantages of income trusts and imposed new taxes on income trusts at corporate tax rates. REITs are exempt from the SIFT rules but must meet certain conditions. One of the most important conditions is that rent received by the REIT must come from real or immovable properties", "s but must meet certain conditions. One of the most important conditions is that rent received by the REIT must come from real or immovable properties.

These funds are then used to purchase units in the market on behalf of the participants. RISK FACTORS There are certain risks associated with REITs. The most apparent risks commonly associated with REITs are summarized below. \u2022 Vacancy: One of the biggest risks that a REIT faces is vacancy of its properties. If the number of tenants drops by too much, the REIT will not receive sufficient rental or lease payments to pass along to unit holders as distributions. \u2022 Liquidity: Real estate is not a liquid asset and large commercial or residential properties are even less liquid. For private REITs, there is no secondary market and securities regulations restrict the resale of the securities. \u2022 Rental Income: If tenants are unable to pay their rent, the REIT\u2019s revenue will fall and distributions to the unit holders will be at risk. With commercial and retail REITs, in addition to minimum rent, the tenant pays a \u201cpercentage rent\u201d which is a percentage of the tenant\u2019s revenues. This income would be at risk where the commercial/retail tenant is struggling or retail markets are in a downturn", "percentage of the tenant\u2019s revenues. This income would be at risk where the commercial/retail tenant is struggling or retail markets are in a downturn. Rent control legislation also limits how often rents can be raised and by how much. \u2022 Leverage: A significant portion of a REIT\u2019s activities is financed using mortgages and lines of credit. This means it must have sufficient cash flow to meet interest and principal payments and still pay distributions to unit holders. In some cases, REITs leverage properties against the acquisition of other properties. This model increases the risk to investors where there is a default on one property secured against another property. REITs that are highly leveraged will have increased risk associated with the investment. It is important to examine how much debt a REIT is carrying relative to its book value. \u2022 Excess Distributions: When a REIT\u2019s distribution exceeds its cash flow from operations, it is considered an excess distribution. Typically, excess distributions are funded by taking on debt. Borrowing to finance distributions incurs additional interest expense which further reduces the REIT\u2019s ability to pay future distributions", "ng on debt. Borrowing to finance distributions incurs additional interest expense which further reduces the REIT\u2019s ability to pay future distributions. REITs that consistently obtain cash flows from financing sources other than from operations have a higher risk profile. Excess distributions that are financed by debt may indicate that the distributions are not sustainable and future distributions could be suspended. While National Policy 41-201 (NP 41-201), item 6.5.2 and OSC Staff Notice 51-724 (OSCSN 51-724) establish clear disclosure requirements pertaining to excess distributions for reporting issuers, REITs distributed in the exempt market are not obligated to provide these disclosures. It is therefore critical to examine these REITs to determine the amount of the distributions derived from cash flow from operations and any excess distributions funded by borrowed financing. Those REITs that consistently fund excess distributions via debt financing pose the risks of unsustainable distributions and the possibility that distributions could be suspended. \u2022 Market Conditions: Unfavorable real estate market conditions can have a negative impact on a REIT", "possibility that distributions could be suspended. \u2022 Market Conditions: Unfavorable real estate market conditions can have a negative impact on a REIT. The strength of the real estate market will directly affect vacancy rates, rent payments, and the liquidity of the investments within the REIT. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 77 \u2022 16 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE \u2022 Interest Rate Risk: A change in interest rates will have various effects on the unit price of a REIT. In periods of low interest rates, many investors turn to REITs because their yield may be higher than on traditional fixed income products. If interest rates rise, new fixed income issues will reflect that increase and REITs may become less attractive. Where the REIT is leveraged, increased interest rates will translate into an increased interest expense which could put distributions at risk. \u2022 Property Management: If the property manager does not keep the properties in good repair, their value will fall. \u2022 Development Risk: For properties under development and/or renovation, development risks related to the project(s) would be applicable", "lue will fall. \u2022 Development Risk: For properties under development and/or renovation, development risks related to the project(s) would be applicable. \u2022 Environmental Risk: Federal and provincial laws could hold the REIT, as an owner of property, liable for environmental issues. \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE 2 CONTENT AREAS What is a Mortgage Investment Corporation?

WHAT IS A MORTGAGE INVESTMENT CORPORATION? A mortgage investment corporation (MIC) is an issuer and lending institution which: \u2022 offers shares of the corporation to investors \u2022 invests the proceeds from the offering into mortgages secured by real property by lending to mortgage borrowers Figure 7.2 Lending Dividends Shareholders Mortgage Investment Corporation Mortgage Brorrowers Capital Payments The MIC\u2019s shareholders receive income from the MIC mortgage pool. Similar to investors of mortgage-backed securities, the shareholders of MICs receive principal and interest earned on the underlying assets in the portfolio. In essence, the debt payments that the borrowers make on their mortgages are flowed through to the shareholders of the MIC. Additional revenue may be generated from various fees paid by the borrower, usually at the time the mortgage is funded. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MORTGAGE INVESTMENT CORPORATIONS A mortgage investment corporation (MIC) is a pool of mortgages offered to investors as a security", "CHARACTERISTICS OF MORTGAGE INVESTMENT CORPORATIONS A mortgage investment corporation (MIC) is a pool of mortgages offered to investors as a security. The security is backed by mortgages which are secured against the real property mortgaged and it provides investors with an income stream by way of dividends. \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 77 \u2022 20 LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS Mortgages, by definition, are secured by real property. MICs will generally have investment guidelines which will establish limits for the loan-to-value ratio (e.g. 75% of the value of the property). EXAMPLE Ivan needs to obtain a mortgage for a property valued at $100,000. The MIC\u2019s loan-to-value ratio (LTV) is established at 75%. Therefore, the maximum amount that Ivan can borrow is $75,000.00. FLOW-THROUGH INVESTMENTS MICs are flow-through investments, meaning that tax is not paid by the corporation. Rather, income is flowed through to the investors. The criteria for eligibility for MICs, under the Tax Act (Canada), are summarized in the table below", "ather, income is flowed through to the investors. The criteria for eligibility for MICs, under the Tax Act (Canada), are summarized in the table below.

MICs can also participate in syndicated mortgages with multiple lenders, subject to minimums. ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES MICs can appoint administrators to provide services for the administrative, management, operational, and registration aspects of the MIC. Administrative duties related to the MIC include: \u2022 receipt and posting of mortgage payments \u2022 funding new mortgages LESSON 2 MORTGAGE INVESTMENT CORPORATIONS 7 \u2022 21 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE \u2022 renewal of existing mortgages \u2022 property insurance and tax follow up \u2022 maintaining amortization schedules and bank records for the portfolio AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MICs must be audited annually, at the fiscal year end, by an independent accounting firm and the audited financial statements must be made available to the shareholders of the MIC", ", at the fiscal year end, by an independent accounting firm and the audited financial statements must be made available to the shareholders of the MIC. REDEMPTION Most MICs issue common or preferred shares which can be surrendered for redemption under certain circumstances, subject to established time periods. For example, some MICs allow investors to redeem shares, on a periodic basis, for up to 95% of the trading price. Commonly, monthly redemption payment dates are established in the offering documents (offering memorandum) for the MIC. DISTRIBUTION OF MORTGAGE INVESTMENT CORPORATIONS Most commonly, MICs are offered to investors under exemptions from prospectus requirements. As with all securities offered in the exempt market, MICs are distributed primarily by way of an offering memorandum (OM) and may only be purchased by certain investors who qualify for exemption (e.g. accredited investor exemption, eligible investor under the offering memorandum exemption, etc.). You should thoroughly review the offering documents (offering memorandum) as a matter of your due diligence obligations", "g memorandum exemption, etc.). You should thoroughly review the offering documents (offering memorandum) as a matter of your due diligence obligations. REGISTRATION CSA Staff Notice 31-323 establishes requirements with respect to mortgage investment entities (MIEs) including MICs. Pursuant to the notice, all mortgage investment entities (MIEs) which invest in a pool of mortgages (Pooled MIEs) in Alberta are considered investment funds. As such, all Pooled MIEs in Alberta must become registered as an investment fund manager. For all other jurisdictions, CSA Staff Notice 31-323 establishes requirements which include: \u2022 the definition of a mortgage investment entity (MIE): \u2022 company whose purpose is to invest substantially all of its assets in mortgages \u2022 other assets are limited to certain types of assets (deposits, cash, specified debt, etc.) \u2022 the requirement for certain pooled MIEs to become registered as an investment fund manager where: \u2022 the Pooled MIE does not take an active role in originating the mortgages that become part of the investment portfolio, and \u2022 the Pooled MIE buys or sells mortgages in accordance with a stated portfolio investment strategy", "s that become part of the investment portfolio, and \u2022 the Pooled MIE buys or sells mortgages in accordance with a stated portfolio investment strategy. TAX CONSIDERATIONS The tax considerations of any investment should be determined in consultation with a professional tax adviser.

The dividends distributed by a MIC to its shareholders are taxed as interest income, in the hands of the shareholder. CAPITAL GAINS MICs may also flow capital gains to its shareholders. Capital gains distributed must be treated as capital gains of the shareholders and the taxable capital gains must be computed (currently at 50%) and reported in the shareholders\u2019 tax filings.

REGISTERED PLAN ELIGIBILITY AND TFSA s Most MICs are eligible for registered plans such as RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs, RESPs, and RDSPs. BENEFITS OF MORTGAGE INVESTMENT CORPORATIONS Mortgage investment corporations can provide the following benefits: \u2022 Potential for attractive yields: The interest rates charged to the borrowers of MICs are typically higher than market rates, thus resulting in attractive yields. \u2022 Managed investment product: MICs are commonly diversified, professionally managed portfolios. \u2022 Asset-backed investment: MICs are mortgage pools and the underlying mortgages are secured against real property. \u2022 Registered Plans: Most MICs are eligible for registered plans such as RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs, RESPs, and RDSPs. \u2022 Income stream: MIC investors receive dividend payments funded by the income generated from the mortgage pool\u2019s mortgage payments and mortgage fees; the income stream can typically be predictable. \u2022 Redemption feature: Most MICs can be redeemed on a periodic basis (e.g", "e payments and mortgage fees; the income stream can typically be predictable. \u2022 Redemption feature: Most MICs can be redeemed on a periodic basis (e.g. monthly redemptions) as established in the offering documents (offering memorandum) for the MIC FEES AND EXPENSES The fees and expenses may vary from one MIC to another.

WHAT IS A LAND DEVELOPMENT LIMITED PARTNERSHIP? A land development limited partnership (LP) is a security offered to investors to provide them with the opportunity to invest in land development projects. Most land development LPs are offered under an exemption from prospectus requirements and are distributed in the exempt market. Under the LP, the general partner acts as the manager of the land development project. The limited partners are typically passive investors who buy limited partnership units (LPUs). Many land development LPs also create an investment corporation (\u201cIC\u201d) or a trust, complimentary to the LP. The purpose of the IC/trust is to purchase units of the LP and offer shares/units to investors for their registered plans", "st, complimentary to the LP.

The 5 major stages for land development are summarized in the table below. Land Development Cycle Stage 1 Pre-Development \u201cRaw\u201d or undeveloped land Stage 2 Concept Planning Creation of a development blueprint and rezoning of the land for eventual development Stage 3 Horizontal Development Installation of power, pipes, pavement, etc. (servicing) Stage 4 Vertical Development Construction of structures Stage 5 Developed Property Sale, resale, and rental market FUNDING MODELS Land development LPs utilize different funding models in their product structures", "5 Developed Property Sale, resale, and rental market FUNDING MODELS Land development LPs utilize different funding models in their product structures. The different funding models are: ALL-CASH The project allocates a portion of the funds raised up front to: \u2022 segregated reserve accounts for ongoing administrative and planning expenses \u2022 general costs of the company (i.e. overhead) \u2022 costs of the investment product (e.g. sales commissions) \u2022 interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization LEVERAGED The project allocates the majority of the funds raised to purchase the property. The project is then leveraged against the acquisition of another property or alternate financing is secured that must be repaid on a scheduled basis. This funding model increases the risk to investors should the company not be able to cover the costs of the loans or if it defaults on one property secured against another property. You should be fully aware of the LPs funding model as a matter of your due diligence obligations. EXIT STRATEGY The exit strategy for a land development LP is a critical consideration so that investors can realize a return", "ue diligence obligations. EXIT STRATEGY The exit strategy for a land development LP is a critical consideration so that investors can realize a return. In land development LPs, the exit strategy involves the sale of the property or a restructuring arrangement so that the land investment LP is exited and structured into a new investment, often with a new set of investors or another end user. You should be fully aware of the LPs exit strategy as a matter of your due diligence obligations. DISTRIBUTION OF LAND DEVELOPMENT LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS As with all securities offered in the exempt market, land development LPs are distributed primarily by way of an offering memorandum (OM) and may only be purchased by certain investors who qualify for exemption (e.g. accredited investor exemption, eligible investor under the offering memorandum exemption, etc.). LESSON 3 LAND DEVELOPMENT LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS 7 \u2022 29 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE TAX CONSIDERATIONS The tax considerations of any investment should be determined in consultation with a professional tax adviser. For information purposes, the general tax considerations in relation to land development LPs are outlined below", "ation with a professional tax adviser. For information purposes, the general tax considerations in relation to land development LPs are outlined below. LAND HELD AND SOLD AS INVENTORY IS CONSIDERED INCOME Firms in the business of buying and selling land or offering land development as an investment opportunity generally consider their assets as inventory and, as a result, profits are taxed as income, not capital gains. Though this may sound strange at first, there is a simple explanation as demonstrated in the example below. EXAMPLE A convenience store buys a refrigerator for the purpose of chilling its bottled drinks. The drinks they sell are part of their inventory. Proceeds from their drink sales are therefore considered income. The store sells the refrigerator 3 years later for more than they purchased it for. Is it a capital gain or income? Since the store purchased the refrigerator for the purpose of housing drinks and not for the purpose of selling it later for profit, it is seen as a capital asset, not inventory. It is therefore taxed as a capital gain", "g drinks and not for the purpose of selling it later for profit, it is seen as a capital asset, not inventory. It is therefore taxed as a capital gain. If the store entered the business of buying and selling refrigerators for the purpose of making a profit, the refrigerators they purchase would then be seen as inventory and would be taxed as income. That is also why gains on your primary residence are taxed as capital gains, while real estate that is only bought and sold for the purpose of making a profit is usually taxed as income. As with all other limited partnerships, the income of the partnership and the tax owed on that income is allocated to the limited partners (i.e. the unit holders). The unit holders receive the income generated by the limited partnership in its original form (i.e. as income) and then must report the income in their tax filings. The land development LP is required to file Form T5013 (Partnership Information Return) with the CRA and must also issue tax slips to its limited partners. The unit holders of the LP must report the income declared on the tax slips received from the LP in their respective tax filings", "its limited partners. The unit holders of the LP must report the income declared on the tax slips received from the LP in their respective tax filings. LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION STRUCTURE After exit, land development LPs distribute the cash exit proceeds to investors. When there is an investment corporation (IC) or a trust, the IC/trust also receives a cash distribution from the LP upon exit. Where there is an IC, the IC is obligated to pay taxes at the corporate level and then pay the after-tax income to the IC investors (i.e. to the registered plans of the IC investors). TAX ON LAND DEVELOPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES In some cases, land development LPs will invest in properties in the United States (U.S.). When the exit of a land development project in the U.S. results in a distribution to a Canadian investor, a U.S. tax obligation generally applies. In order for Canadian investors to file U.S. taxes, they must first obtain an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). An ITIN application (Form W-7) can be obtained from the IRS website. Canadian residents who invest in a Canadian LP that deals in U.S", "e Service (IRS). An ITIN application (Form W-7) can be obtained from the IRS website.

Land investment and development costs are usually very capital intensive and, as such, costs and expenses paid from the reserve fund can be substantial.

WHAT IS A FLOW-THROUGH SHARE? In order to encourage investment in the exploration and development of natural resources, the federal government has designated certain companies as principal-business corporations (PBCs). PBCs are companies in the resource sector including oil and gas, mining, renewable energy, and energy conservation. These PBCs are permitted to issue flow-through shares. A flow-through share (FTS) is a special kind of share issued by a PBC to a shareholder under an agreement which specifies that eligible exploration and development expenses of the PCB will be \u201crenounced\u201d by the corporation to the shareholder", "r an agreement which specifies that eligible exploration and development expenses of the PCB will be \u201crenounced\u201d by the corporation to the shareholder. Since large expenditures are usually involved in resource exploration and development, the PBC would typically have little revenue to offset the expenses against, thus the tax deductions could not be used. By issuing flow-through shares, the PBC is able to monetize the tax deductions they cannot use. In turn, the shareholder can deduct the expenses from their other sources of income, thereby reducing their income taxes payable. EXAMPLE Jim subscribes for flow-through shares of a resource company in the amount of $100,000. The company uses the subscription proceeds on exploration and development expenses amounting to $100,000 and renounces the expenses to Jim. Jim deducts the renounced expenses of $100,000 as exploration and development expenses in computing his taxable income. Suppose Jim pays tax at a marginal rate of 46%. The tax saving is $46,000 or ($100,000 \u00d7 46%)", "nd development expenses in computing his taxable income. Suppose Jim pays tax at a marginal rate of 46%.

FLOW-THROUGH SHARE AGREEMENT A flow-through share agreement is a written agreement between an investor and a flow-through issuer which specifies that: \u2022 the issuer will incur Canadian exploration expense (CEE) or Canadian development expense (CDE) and the amount of CEE or CDE will not be less than the value of the flow-through shares \u2022 the issuer will renounce to the investor amounts of CEE or CDE that are not more than the value of the flow- through shares The expenses must be incurred within 24 months following the month the agreement is entered into. FLOW-THROUGH WARRANTS Holders of flow-through warrants have a right to require flow-through shares to be issued to them", "the agreement is entered into. FLOW-THROUGH WARRANTS Holders of flow-through warrants have a right to require flow-through shares to be issued to them. When large investors purchase flow-through shares of PBCs, they are sometimes in a position to negotiate flow-through warrants at no additional cost. This has the potential to increase the return on their investment.

ABSENCE OF CASH DISTRIBUTIONS While some LPs make cash distributions to their limited partners, the distributions are usually small and are subject to various factors, including the availability of cash. Consequently, investors should not rely on cash distributions from the LP to discharge the tax liability on amounts of income or capital gains which are allocated to them by the LP. Nor should investors rely on cash distributions to service the interest payments and principal repayment of any loans contracted by them to purchase LP units. Investors should ensure that they have the means to finance these payments from sources other than cash distributions from the LP. MUTUAL FUND ROLLOVER EVENT At the end of the term of a flow-through LP, the limited partners may receive units of a mutual fund in exchange for their LP units. At that point, investors may wish to redeem the mutual fund units and exit the investment. Redemption is necessary if the investor wants to adopt a strategy of recycling the tax savings", "o redeem the mutual fund units and exit the investment. Redemption is necessary if the investor wants to adopt a strategy of recycling the tax savings. You should review the investment objectives and portfolio of the mutual fund and ensure that it holds sufficient investments in liquid securities to be able to meet the redemption proceeds. DISTRIBUTION OF FLOW-THROUGH SHARES Issuers offer flow-through shares in one of two ways: \u2022 a public offering under a prospectus \u2022 a private placement under an exemption from prospectus requirements Unlike other public securities offered by prospectus, such as common shares, investors cannot sell, trade, or redeem their flow-through shares on any market. Regardless of whether the flow-through shares are issued as a public offering or a private placement, there is no trading or liquidity in the shares until the \u201cliquidity event\u201d, prescribed in the offering documents, occurs. The liquidity event constitutes a point when the flow-through shares \u201crollover\u201d and convert into an open-end mutual fund", "e offering documents, occurs. The liquidity event constitutes a point when the flow-through shares \u201crollover\u201d and convert into an open-end mutual fund. While the mutual fund will provide a redemption feature, between the time the flow-through shares are purchased and the mutual fund rollover, the flow-through shares are not tradable. This, in large part, is derivative of the tax flow-through features of the security. Similar to other public securities offered by prospectus, public flow-through shares are subject to prospectus filing and continuous disclosure requirements. Many issuers offer flow-through shares as private placements under an exemption from prospectus requirements. As with all securities offered in the exempt market, flow-through limited partnerships are distributed primarily by way of an offering memorandum (OM) and may only be purchased by certain investors who qualify for exemption (e.g. accredited investor exemption, eligible investor under the offering memorandum exemption, etc.).

CALCULATING THE CANADIAN EXPLORATION EXPENSES (CEE) DEDUCTIONS Unit holders of a flow-through LP may deduct from their income an amount equal to 100% of the CEE renounced to them. The amount of the tax deduction depends on the taxpayer\u2019s marginal tax rate as illustrated in the example below. EXAMPLE Wendy invests $10,000 in units of a flow-through LP. CEE totaling $10,000 is allocated to her in the same year. Wendy\u2019s marginal tax rate is 46%. Initial investment $10,000 CEE deduction \u00d7 marginal tax rate ($10,000 \u00d7 46%) $4,600 The two assumptions made in this example are: \u2022 In the year of the investment into the flow-through LP, the amount of the deduction for CEE is equal to the cost of the investment. In practice, the amount of the deduction in the first year will usually lie in the range of 90% to 100%, with the balance being deductible in future years", "ractice, the amount of the deduction in the first year will usually lie in the range of 90% to 100%, with the balance being deductible in future years. \u2022 The investor has sufficient taxable income to use the deduction. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 88 \u2022 14 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE CALCULATING CAPITAL GAINS Unit holders of a flow-through LP will be required to include capital gains in their tax filings. In calculating the adjusted cost base (ACB) of the flow-through LP unit (LPU), the LPU is deemed to have an ACB of zero when purchased. The ACB is zero even if the amount of renounced expenses is less than the cost of the investment. Indeed, even if no resource expenses at all are renounced, the ACB is still zero. The effect of this rule can be punitive. EXAMPLE Suppose Samuel is the initial purchaser of flow-through shares with a cost of $200,000. The issuer does not renounce resource expenses to the investor. After a year, Samuel sells the flow-through shares for the same price of $200,000. Since the ACB of the shares is zero, he realizes a capital gain of $200,000, half of which is taxable", "w-through shares for the same price of $200,000. Since the ACB of the shares is zero, he realizes a capital gain of $200,000, half of which is taxable. Samuel has not benefited from any tax deduction but is required to pay tax on a capital gain which exists only for tax purposes. ADJUSTED COST BASE (ACB) OF A FLOW-THROUGH LIMITED PARTNERSHIP UNIT (LPU) The ACB of a flow-through LPU is calculated as shown in the formula below. Formula: ACB of a Flow-Through LPU A + (B \u2212 C \u2212 D) = E Where: A = the subscription price paid for the unit, plus B = any share of income allocated to the unit holder, less C = any share of losses and CEE allocated to the unit holder, less D = the amount of any cash distributions made to the unit holder E = Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) As a result of the application of this formula, the ACB of a flow-through LPU is generally zero or minimal. If the ACB becomes less than zero, the amount of any negative ACB is deemed to be a capital gain of the unit holder in the year in which the ACB becomes negative", "becomes less than zero, the amount of any negative ACB is deemed to be a capital gain of the unit holder in the year in which the ACB becomes negative. ADJUSTED COST BASE (ACB) OF UNITS OF THE ROLLOVER MUTUAL FUND At the end of the LP\u2019s term, the units of the flow-through LP are converted to units of an open-end mutual fund. The \u201crollover\u201d to the mutual fund takes place on a tax-deferred basis. The ACB of the mutual fund units is equal to the ACB of the LP units, i.e. zero or minimal. When the investor redeems his mutual fund units, the entire redemption proceeds, net of any costs of disposition, constitute a taxable gain, half of which must be included in taxable income. LESSON 2 TAX CONSIDERATIONS OF FLOW-THROUGH SHARES 8 \u2022 15 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXAMPLE Wendy invests $10,000 in units of a flow-through LP.

Wendy\u2019s marginal tax rate is 46%", "s allocated to her in the same year. After the mutual fund rollover, Wendy redeems the mutual fund units for $10,000. Wendy\u2019s marginal tax rate is 46%. Initial investment $10,000 CEE $10,000 ACB of flow-through LPU 0 ACB of mutual fund units 0 Redemption of mutual fund units $10,000 Capital Gain ($10,000 \u2212 0) $10,000 Taxable Amount of Capital Gain $10,000 \u00d7 50%) $5,000 Tax Payable ($5,000 \u00d7 46%) $2,300 CALCULATING THE NET TAX BENEFIT Calculating the net tax benefit considers the CEE deduction from the flow-through LPUs and the capital gain on disposition of the rollover mutual fund units. Formula: Net Tax Benefit A \u2212 B = C Where: A = CEE tax deduction B = tax payable on the capital gain C = Net Tax Benefit EXAMPLE Using the same example as for the CEE and capital gain for Wendy who invests $10,000 in units of a flow- through LP and redeems the mutual fund units for $10,000. CEE deduction \u00d7 marginal tax rate ($10,000 \u00d7 46%) $4,600 Tax payable on taxable capital gain ($5,000 \u00d7 46%) ($2,300) Net Tax Benefit $2,300 The taxpayer also benefits from the time value of money. The initial tax saving arises when they invest in the flow- through LPUs", "t Tax Benefit $2,300 The taxpayer also benefits from the time value of money. The initial tax saving arises when they invest in the flow- through LPUs. On the other hand, the tax on the capital gain only arises on the redemption of the mutual fund units approximately two years later. The net tax benefit depends on the investor\u2019s marginal tax rate. It is highest for an investor who pays the top marginal income tax rate. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 88 \u2022 16 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE CALCULATING THE BREAK-EVEN POINT An important concept in flow-through investing is the break-even point. Because of the net tax benefit, it is possible for the investment in the flow-through LP to lose value without the investor losing any money. The break-even point indicates the value of the investment at which point there is no profit or loss to the investor. Formula: Break-Even Point A \u2212 B = C Where: A = Initial investment B = Net Tax Benefit C = Break Even Point EXAMPLE Continuing from the same example for the CEE, capital gain, and net tax benefit for Wendy, the break-even point is $7 ,700", "= Break Even Point EXAMPLE Continuing from the same example for the CEE, capital gain, and net tax benefit for Wendy, the break-even point is $7 ,700. Initial investment $10,000 Net Tax Benefit ($2,300) Break-Even Point $7 ,700 The investment loss for the break-even point is $2,300. Redemption proceeds at break-even point $7 ,700 Initial investment $10,000 Investment Loss ($2,300) In the example above, when the value of the investment drops to $7 ,700, the investment loss is exactly offset by the net tax savings, and the investor makes neither a profit nor a loss. In other words, the value of the investment can drop by as much as $2,300 or ($10,000 \u2212 $7 ,700) without the investor losing any money. This corresponds to a drop of 23% in the initial value of the investment. The above analysis does not take any Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) into account. The break-even point will be even lower if ITCs are available. LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF CEE It is important to note that the tax deductions for flow-through shares are subject to certain provisions and rules in the Tax Act which may restrict the ability of a unit holder to deduct certain expenses and losses", "hares are subject to certain provisions and rules in the Tax Act which may restrict the ability of a unit holder to deduct certain expenses and losses. These rules include the: \u2022 at-risk rule \u2022 tax shelter investment rule on limited recourse debt Both the at-risk rule and the tax shelter investment rule on limited recourse debt may reduce the expenditures of the unit holder by the limited recourse amounts or the at-risk amounts. Both rules consider amounts borrowed by LESSON 2 TAX CONSIDERATIONS OF FLOW-THROUGH SHARES 8 \u2022 17 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE the unit holder in order to invest in the flow-through shares. To ensure that their limited partners do not fall foul of the tax shelter investment rules, flow-through LPs sometimes make arrangements with financial institutions to make available to their investors loans which meet the required conditions. An investor who finances the purchase of flow-through LPUs by means of a loan should make sure that recourse for the loan is not, and is not deemed to be, limited (e.g. a limited amount of the principal is secured, etc.). QU\u00c9BEC RESIDENTS Special considerations exist under the Tax Act for Qu\u00e9bec", "d to be, limited (e.g. a limited amount of the principal is secured, etc.). QU\u00c9BEC RESIDENTS Special considerations exist under the Tax Act for Qu\u00e9bec. \u2022 Individual residents in Qu\u00e9bec may be entitled, for Qu\u00e9bec income tax purposes, to a deduction of up to 150% of certain eligible exploration expenses incurred in Qu\u00e9bec by a qualifying entity. This will increase the value of the tax deduction. \u2022 For Qu\u00e9bec income tax purposes, the investor may also be exempted from tax on the portion of the capital gain represented by the difference between the purchase price of the flow-through share and the ACB of zero. Rather, the profit on the difference between the sale proceeds and the purchase price is treated as a capital gain. \u2022 For Qu\u00e9bec income tax purposes, the investment expenses incurred by an individual taxpayer in a given taxation year must be compared with the investment income earned for that year. For this purpose, investment expenses include certain deductible interest and losses of the taxpayer and 50% of CEE incurred outside Qu\u00e9bec and deducted for Qu\u00e9bec income tax purposes. Investment income includes taxable capital gains not eligible for the capital gains exemption", "side Qu\u00e9bec and deducted for Qu\u00e9bec income tax purposes. Investment income includes taxable capital gains not eligible for the capital gains exemption. If the investment expenses exceed the investment income, the excess is included in the taxpayer\u2019s income, thereby offsetting the deduction for that portion of the investment expenses. The portion of the investment expenses, including any CEE, which has been included in the taxpayer\u2019s income in a given taxation year may be carried back and applied against net investment income earned in any of the three previous years or carried forward and applied against net investment income in any subsequent taxation year. The first two considerations will lower the break-even point for a taxpayer who is a resident of Qu\u00e9bec. On the other hand, if the taxpayer is unable to deduct the CEE fully as a result of the third consideration, the break-even point will be increased. CALCULATING DEDUCTIONS USING CUMULATIVE CEE AND CDE POOLS CEE and CDE renounced to a unit holder by an issuer during a year are not deducted directly from the taxpayer\u2019s income. Instead, they are added to the taxpayer\u2019s cumulative CEE and CDE pools", "y an issuer during a year are not deducted directly from the taxpayer\u2019s income. Instead, they are added to the taxpayer\u2019s cumulative CEE and CDE pools. The taxpayer reports the accumulation and depletion of CEE and CDE on CRA Form T1229. The amount of CEE and CDE which may be claimed as a deduction for the year is: \u2022 CEE: 100% of the balance available as calculated on CRA Form T1229 \u2022 CDE: 30% of the balance available as calculated on CRA Form T1229 Any unclaimed amounts may be carried forward to future years indefinitely. Generally, a taxpayer will continue to be entitled to deduct amounts from his cumulative CEE and CDE pools even if they sell their units of the limited partnership or the rollover mutual fund. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 88 \u2022 18 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE TAX DEFERRAL The timing of the CEE and CDE tax deductions and the subsequent realization of capital gains allows for tax deferral. This is an additional tax advantage because for most taxpayers it is better to pay taxes in the future, especially if the investor enters a lower tax bracket in future years", "ax advantage because for most taxpayers it is better to pay taxes in the future, especially if the investor enters a lower tax bracket in future years. The timeline of a flow-through LP typically runs two years, although investors may hold their rollover units indefinitely. In Year 1, the investment gives rise to a tax refund. In Year 2, capital gains taxes are deferred until eventual disposition. It is the timing of these cash flows that allows for tax deferral and an enhanced internal rate of return (IRR).

TAXABLE CAPITAL GAINS The income of the LP includes the taxable portion of any capital gain that it realizes on the disposition of flow- through shares in its portfolio. The ACB of the flow-through shares is deemed to be nil. Consequently, the amount of capital gains will generally be equal to the proceeds of disposition of the flow-through shares, less costs of disposition. FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE INITIAL OFFERING The fees and expenses of the initial offering are an expense of the LP. Some flow-through LPs finance the fees and expenses of the initial offering by means of a loan. The outstanding principal and interest on the loan constitutes a limited-recourse amount of the LP. Limited-recourse amounts have adverse tax consequences. The fees and expenses are not deductible in computing the LP\u2019s taxable income until the borrowed amount is repaid. 20% of the amount repaid is deductible in the year of repayment and 20% in each of the next four years", "ble income until the borrowed amount is repaid. 20% of the amount repaid is deductible in the year of repayment and 20% in each of the next four years. The LP is not entitled to deduct any amount in respect of the fees and expenses in the fiscal year ending on its dissolution. LESSON 2 TAX CONSIDERATIONS OF FLOW-THROUGH SHARES 8 \u2022 19 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE After the dissolution of the LP, any person who was a limited partner immediately prior to the dissolution may deduct in a taxation year ending after that time their pro rata share of the amount which the LP would have been entitled to deduct if it had continued to exist. The adjusted cost base of the LP units will be reduced on dissolution of the LP by their share of that amount. MANAGEMENT FEES AND OPERATING COSTS The annual management fees and operating costs are expenses of the LP. Unit holders are allocated their pro rata share of the expenses. REGISTERED PLAN ELIGIBILITY AND TFSAS Flow-through LPUs are not eligible to be held within registered plans such as RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs, RESPs, and RDSPs. Given the tax deductions, an investment in a flow-through LP has some similarity to a contribution to an RRSP", "s RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs, RESPs, and RDSPs. Given the tax deductions, an investment in a flow-through LP has some similarity to a contribution to an RRSP. However, any amount withdrawn from an RRSP is taxable as income whereas disposition of rollover mutual fund units gives rise to a taxable capital gain. SIFT RULES Even when flow-through LPs are publicly distributed, they are not listed or traded on a stock exchange or other public market. Consequently, the SIFT Rules do not apply to flow-through LPs. LEGITIMATE TAX SHELTER Tax shelters as a group may have a questionable reputation among investors and the CRA. Promoters of tax shelters often operate in grey areas that the CRA later challenges. Should CRA disallow a tax shelter, the investors will face reassessment. However, flow-through investments offer investors a legitimate tax break with tangible tax benefits. Flow-through shares have existed in one form or another since 1954 and the tax deductions and benefits related to flow-through shares have been specifically codified within the Tax Act (Canada) and provincial tax acts", "and the tax deductions and benefits related to flow-through shares have been specifically codified within the Tax Act (Canada) and provincial tax acts. PROFESSIONAL TAX ADVICE As with any complex tax-driven investment, investors should consult a qualified tax advisor to determine if the tax benefit is appropriate for them.

SUITABILITY CONSIDERATIONS As with any complex tax-driven investment, investors should consult a qualified tax advisor to determine if the tax benefit is appropriate for them. While the tax advantages of a flow-through investment are important, they should not be an investor\u2019s only consideration. The investor\u2019s risk profile is a critical factor, in particular their ability to absorb losses and their willingness to invest in speculative junior resource companies", "sk profile is a critical factor, in particular their ability to absorb losses and their willingness to invest in speculative junior resource companies. While professionally managed LPs spread risk across a number of individual flow-through shares, volatility in the resource sector can be high and returns are unpredictable. Another important element to consider is liquidity. In the case of a flow-through LP, the investor\u2019s capital is locked-in for at least a year, and usually longer. If these conditions are acceptable, a flow-through investment and its worthwhile tax benefits may fit as part of a well-diversified portfolio. CHOOSING BETWEEN CEE AND CDE FLOW-THROUGH INVESTMENTS The choice between the two forms of flow-through deduction depends on the investor\u2019s personal tax situation and risk profile. ONE-TIME DEDUCTION VERSUS MULTI-YEAR DEDUCTION CEE is 100% deductible in the year the expense is incurred. In contrast, CDE is tax-deductible at a rate of 30% on a declining balance basis. For example, 30% is deductible in year one, 21% (30% of 70%) in year two and so on. Therefore, deductions are spread over a longer period of time than those available from CEE", "tible in year one, 21% (30% of 70%) in year two and so on. Therefore, deductions are spread over a longer period of time than those available from CEE. As a way to stack their CDE deductions, investors may roll over their CDE flow-through investment year after year to accumulate deductions from current and past years. They can also carry deductions forward to high income years. LESSON 3 THE BENEFITS OF FLOW-THROUGH SHARES 8 \u2022 25 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE PREMIUM Because of the tax benefits granted to CEE flow-through shares, companies issue them at a premium to the market price of the ordinary common shares. Relative to CEE, underwriters of CDE flow-through shares negotiate issue prices with a smaller premium to the market price to reflect the lower demand and the smaller initial tax deduction for CDE flow-through. RISK In oil and gas drilling, CDE is incurred to develop proven oil and gas pools with an outcome that is more certain because of the higher quality and quantity of information available on the drilling prospect. In mining, CDE is incurred in sinking a shaft, haulage way, or similar underground work for use in a producing mine", "vailable on the drilling prospect. In mining, CDE is incurred in sinking a shaft, haulage way, or similar underground work for use in a producing mine. CDE flow-through does not expose investors to the risky exploration activity typical of CEE flow-through investments. SIZE Intermediate producers issue CDE flow-through shares to finance production growth. Because they are producing, not just exploring, CDE issuers are typically stronger companies with more robust cash flow and better analyst coverage. Generally, shares of larger issuers also have better trading liquidity and lower business risk. COMBINING CDE AND CEE UNITS Combining CDE and CEE is another strategy an investor could consider, for example allocating a percentage to each category. EXAMPLE If George combines 70% CDE with 30% CEE flow-through, George can deduct 51% of his total investment in year 1 and the remaining 49% on a declining balance basis", "combines 70% CDE with 30% CEE flow-through, George can deduct 51% of his total investment in year 1 and the remaining 49% on a declining balance basis. \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE 4 CONTENT AREAS Overview of Fees and Expenses Fees and Expenses of Flow-Through Limited Partnerships LESSON 4 FEES AND EXPENSES OF FLOW-THROUGH LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS 8 \u2022 29 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE INTRODUCTION In this lesson, you will learn about the fees and expenses associated with flow-through limited partnerships.

In some cases, the manager may pay a trailer fee to the EMD(s) from the management fees (e.g. 0.25% per annum). CALCULATING THE NET ASSET VALUE The net asset value (NAV) of a flow-through LP is calculated in the same manner as a mutual fund. The investment manager determines the value for their net assets in the portfolio and then determines the NAV per unit. The NAV is used as the basis for the calculation of the management fee. The NAV is also used in calculating the conversion ratio when the LP units are rolled over into the mutual fund at the end of the term.

RISK FACTORS OF FLOW-THROUGH SHARES The first consideration when contemplating a flow-through investment for a potential investor is their willingness and ability to tolerate the risk associated with adding junior resource companies to their portfolio. The second consideration is the tax benefit, which must be weighed only after you are certain that the client can bear the risks, including the risk of severe capital loss. RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE RESOURCE SECTOR The business of a resource company is inherently risky because the discovery of commercially viable quantities of oil, gas, or minerals is unpredictable. The actual production levels of resource companies may be below expectations for a variety of reasons, including equipment breakdowns and unplanned shutdowns arising from hazards such as unusual or unexpected formations, rock bursts, cave-ins, fires, explosions, blowouts, formations of abnormal pressure, power outages, landslides, and flooding", "or unexpected formations, rock bursts, cave-ins, fires, explosions, blowouts, formations of abnormal pressure, power outages, landslides, and flooding. Other factors which affect the profitability of a resource company include: \u2022 commodity prices \u2022 the demand for commodities \u2022 general economic conditions \u2022 unanticipated depletion of reserves \u2022 native land claims \u2022 liability for environmental damage \u2022 measures to protect agricultural lands \u2022 inability to hire the required labour or obtain the required equipment \u2022 competition from other resource companies \u2022 the imposition of tariffs, duties, or other taxes EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 88 \u2022 34 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE \u2022 government regulations affecting the conditions under which oil, gas, and minerals may be developed, produced, and exported \u2022 increases in royalties For these reasons, the analysis of resource companies is difficult. To compound the difficulty, many resource companies lack a history of earnings and dividends", "reasons, the analysis of resource companies is difficult. To compound the difficulty, many resource companies lack a history of earnings and dividends. Factors to consider when evaluating an investment in a flow-through LP include: \u2022 whether the LP will invest only in mining stocks or in the oil and gas sector as well \u2022 whether the LP will invest primarily in the shares of junior issuers or will there be a mix of junior and more senior issuers When considering junior issuers, it is important to note that while junior issuers may have the potential for attractive returns, junior issuers are speculative investments. VOLATILITY RISK AND CYCLICAL RETURNS Before investment is made in a flow-through share, the investor should be aware of the potential for considerable volatility. The resource sector is cyclical, and in cyclical sectors a period of good performance is inevitably followed by a period of poor performance", "latility. The resource sector is cyclical, and in cyclical sectors a period of good performance is inevitably followed by a period of poor performance. Volatility can arise for a number of reasons including: \u2022 flow-through issuers are typically junior or intermediate companies with more volatile share prices than larger companies \u2022 the resource sector is subject to rapid changes in commodity prices which cannot be predicted or easily managed \u2022 the cyclical nature of the resource sector results in cyclical returns LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk arises when an investment product cannot be sold at a fair price, without penalty, and be converted to cash on short notice. Investors in flow-through LPs expose themselves to liquidity risk in two ways. First, the investor must hold the LP until the partnership is dissolved. This could be as long as 24 months after the time of purchase. Second, the underlying companies held in the flow-through LP\u2019s portfolio may not be liquid investments, thus further impacting the liquidity of the LP", "Second, the underlying companies held in the flow-through LP\u2019s portfolio may not be liquid investments, thus further impacting the liquidity of the LP. CONCENTRATION RISK Flow-through LPs are inherently subject to concentration risk because they are invested in the resource sector in order to benefit from their favourable tax shelter treatment. As such, the portfolios of the LPs invest in companies with high correlations tied to the same market sector. The higher the correlation, the higher the risk", ", the portfolios of the LPs invest in companies with high correlations tied to the same market sector. The higher the correlation, the higher the risk. Flow-through LPs commonly follow investment criteria designed to mitigate concentration and liquidity risks, such as: \u2022 At least 80% of the portfolio will be invested in resource companies that are listed on a stock exchange \u2022 At least 25% of the portfolio will be invested in resource companies that are listed on a senior exchange such as the TSX, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, the London Stock Exchange (including the Alternative Investment Market), the Australian Stock Exchange and the South African JSE Securities Exchange LESSON 5 RISK FACTORS OF FLOW-THROUGH LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS 8 \u2022 35 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE \u2022 Not more than 20% of the portfolio will be invested in a single resource company \u2022 The LP will not own more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a resource company or purchase securities of a resource company for the purpose of exercising control or management over the company Despite the foregoing criteria, a typical flow-through LP is a concentrated portfolio of junior", "of exercising control or management over the company Despite the foregoing criteria, a typical flow-through LP is a concentrated portfolio of junior resource companies without significant assets or financial strength. As such, they are subject to unpredictable swings in value. BLIND POOL RISK At the time that investors subscribe for units of a flow-through LP, no investment in PBCs will have been made. The investors are effectively investing in a blind pool. This means that capital is raised from investors before the issuer formally discloses or reports how the capital will be invested. Blind pools offer few restrictions or safeguards for investor security. The investors are totally dependent on the general partner and investment manager to discharge their duties honestly, in good faith, and in the best interests of the limited partners and to invest the LP\u2019s money wisely. Therefore, the track record, integrity, and capabilities of the general partner and investment manager are essential factors for consideration when selecting a flow-through LP", "rd, integrity, and capabilities of the general partner and investment manager are essential factors for consideration when selecting a flow-through LP. PREMIUM RISK Due to competition, PBCs are often able to issue flow-through shares at a premium to the market price of similar common shares that do not offer tax benefits. A large premium substantially reduces the investor\u2019s prospects for a return on investment. Most analysts agree that there is little prospect for a return when the premium reaches approximately 30%. Generally, managers with buying power who are continuously present in the market may be able to obtain better prices than managers with less buying power or with a sporadic presence. The buying power of the LP\u2019s manager is therefore an important factor for consideration when selecting a flow-through LP. RISK OF UNSUBSCRIBED AMOUNTS It is important for the LP to enter into share purchase agreements with resource companies for the total amount subscribed by the end of the year. If it is unable to do so, any amounts not committed will be returned pro rata to the unit holders", "the total amount subscribed by the end of the year. If it is unable to do so, any amounts not committed will be returned pro rata to the unit holders. In this event, the tax deductions available to the unit holders will be reduced which could result in negative tax consequences to the unit holders. The unit holders may be required to repay any portion of the subscription price that has been returned to them if it is necessary to pay creditors who extended credit to the LP or whose claims otherwise arose before the amount was returned. RISKS RELATED TO THE MUTUAL FUND ROLLOVER At the end of the term of a flow-through LP (usually 18 to 24 months), the \u201cliquidity event\u201d prescribed in the offering documents is scheduled to occur. The liquidity event constitutes a point when the flow-through shares \u201crollover\u201d and convert into an open-end mutual fund. The mutual fund units are then distributed pro rata to the limited partners and the LP is dissolved. If the mutual fund rollover does not take place, perhaps because the LP failed to receive a required approval, the limited partners will receive their pro rata share of its assets when the LP winds up", "erhaps because the LP failed to receive a required approval, the limited partners will receive their pro rata share of its assets when the LP winds up. In this event, it may be problematic for the limited partners to exit their investment because there may not be a liquid market for the shares of the resource companies, or the shares may be subject to resale restrictions. Alternatively, the limited partners may decide not to wind up the LP but to continue it in operation. This would require approval by means of an extraordinary resolution, one passed by at least two-thirds of the votes cast at a duly convened meeting of the limited partners. It is not clear what liquidity the limited partners will obtain for their units in this event", "cast at a duly convened meeting of the limited partners.

Alongside the offering documents, the prospectus (public) or offering memorandum (private), the required reporting issuer disclosures, and the technical reports (Form 43-101F1) prescribed under securities regulation, all other supporting documents warrant thorough examination and review. Other supporting documents include those which detail the company's corporate history, experience and capabilities of management, and projections for viability. ECONOMIC AND FEASIBILITY REPORTS If a mineral deposit is discovered, advanced-stage exploration is carried out which encompasses feasibility studies including: \u2022 Preliminary Economic Assessment (lowest confidence level) \u2022 Preliminary Feasibility Study (reasonable confidence level) \u2022 Feasibility Study (highest confidence level) PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT A preliminary economic assessment is a study that includes an economic analysis of the potential viability of mineral resources (sometimes also referred to as a \u201cscoping study\u201d)", "ssment is a study that includes an economic analysis of the potential viability of mineral resources (sometimes also referred to as a \u201cscoping study\u201d). PRELIMINARY FEASIBILITY STUDY A preliminary feasibility study is a comprehensive study of a range of options for the technical and economic viability of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where a preferred mining method is established, and an effective method of mineral processing is determined. It includes a financial analysis based on reasonable assumptions on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, and social and governmental considerations sufficient for the qualified person (QP) to determine if all or part of a mineral resource may be classified as a mineral reserve", "ental considerations sufficient for the qualified person (QP) to determine if all or part of a mineral resource may be classified as a mineral reserve.

The results of the study may serve as the basis for a final decision to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project. MINERAL ASSESSMENT REPORT Most provinces and territories require a recorded holder of a mining claim to complete and file certain mineral assessment work reports to maintain a mining claim in good standing", "s require a recorded holder of a mining claim to complete and file certain mineral assessment work reports to maintain a mining claim in good standing. The experience and technical knowledge of the team performing this work will guide the value of the mineral prospect. The report must show the location, nature, and extent of the work, the persons who performed the work, the date of performance, and other prescribed information. AGREEMENTS The legal construct under which a mining company develops its project can have a direct bearing on its return on investment. As such, legal agreements between the mining company and other parties are of critical importance and therefore warrant thorough review. Some of these agreements include: \u2022 Joint Venture Agreements \u2022 Royalty Agreements \u2022 Offtake Agreements JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS The capital costs of mining projects begin to climb exponentially as the search for minerals leads to exploration and development in more remote and elevated areas of the world. Many major producing mining companies are now entering into joint ventures as a means of sharing financial commitments and risk in order to develop mining projects", "oducing mining companies are now entering into joint ventures as a means of sharing financial commitments and risk in order to develop mining projects. The terms of the governing joint venture agreement will establish the financial and other related rights, liabilities, and obligations of the joint venture parties. ROYALTY AGREEMENTS Royalties often encumber mining rights interests. As prospectors transfer their mining rights to companies capable of development and operation, royalties are often retained as a means of participating in the potential mineral production. Some projects may have multiple royalties layered on mineral production from a mine. The number and terms of such royalty agreements can significantly affect the financial viability of a mining investment. Royalties are often in the form of vendor take-back, but they may also arise as a form of direct financing or as a means of ongoing income participation after the dilution of interest. The terms of any royalty agreement(s) must be examined to determine the impact of the royalties on the projected cash flow of a project and the value of the mining investment", "agreement(s) must be examined to determine the impact of the royalties on the projected cash flow of a project and the value of the mining investment. LESSON 3 OTHER SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS FOR MINING INVESTMENTS 9 \u2022 19 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS Offtake agreements are agreements between a producer and a buyer of a resource. The buyer agrees to buy all or a portion of the producer\u2019s future production from a specified facility. Offtake agreements are frequently used in natural resource development where the capital costs to extract the resource is significant and the company wants to ensure that some of its product will be sold. If potential lenders or investors are confident that the company will have a buyer for all or a significant portion of its production, it makes it easier to obtain financing to construct a mine. Recent years have seen major international mining companies enter into equity investments of start-up mine projects and simultaneously enter into offtake agreements to ensure product supply. There are several factors that should be considered when dealing with offtake agreements in relation to quality, quantity, and price", "e product supply. There are several factors that should be considered when dealing with offtake agreements in relation to quality, quantity, and price.

In order to embark on exploration and development for oil and gas, a company must first obtain rights from the government as follows: \u2022 Mineral Claim: The holder of a recorded claim acquires the exclusive right to prospect for minerals within the designated area. The recorded claim secures the holder priority for obtaining mineral rights over other parties. Work commitments must be met annually to keep claims in good standing including geological mapping, drilling, and other work. \u2022 Mineral Rights: The acquisition of a lease secures title to the minerals for production. The leaseholder owns the exclusive rights to the minerals within the designated area. Yearly lease payments must be made and royalties on the production of the minerals must be paid to the Crown.

To maximize recovery, multiple methods may involve both: \u2022 Primary recovery \u2022 Secondary (enhanced) recovery Oil Sands Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water, clay, and bitumen. Bitumen is oil that is too heavy or thick to flow or be pumped without being diluted or heated. Oil sands are recovered using two main methods: \u2022 Open-pit mining (20%) \u2022 In situ drilling with thermal techniques (80%) Gas Natural gas is recovered by drilling wells into the ground to remove the gas. Similar to oil recovery, the methods for recovery vary depending on the rock formations of the reserve and can commonly include methods such as fracking. REFINING OIL Oil refining turns crude oil into marketable products. The refining process starts with fractional distillation which separates the crude oil into separate components. The products are then further processed and improved with chemical additives to produce marketable products including gasoline, diesel, heating oil, and jet fuel as well as residual products including asphalt and industrial fuel", "o produce marketable products including gasoline, diesel, heating oil, and jet fuel as well as residual products including asphalt and industrial fuel. GAS PROCESSING Gas processing turns natural gas into marketable products. The gas process starts with dehydration to remove water from the gas and then it is treated in order to separate the product into pipe-line quality products which include ethane, propane, and methane (known as natural gas). DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSPORTATION The oil and gas sector includes the distribution and transportation component of the industry. Oil and gas are transported from the refineries to terminals, and then from the terminals to wholesale and retail outlets. Oil and gas are transported by pipelines, tankers, rail and truck.

OIL AND GAS PRICES One of the important factors to consider when contemplating an investment in oil and gas, or any other commodity, is the price of the commodity itself. The price that the commodity commands in the marketplace will have a direct bearing on corporate profits, plans for expansion and production projects, and ultimately performance of the investment. Oil and gas prices are established in the market based on variables including supply and demand, production levels, storage levels, and views on future trends in any of these or other variables", "arket based on variables including supply and demand, production levels, storage levels, and views on future trends in any of these or other variables. The price movement of an oil and gas investment will be impacted by the following price factors: \u2022 Benchmark price \u2022 Barrel of oil equivalent \u2022 Market differentials BENCHMARK PRICE The benchmarks for oil and gas provide the reference price for buying and selling oil and gas.

As with any other commodity, prices are determined by the market forces of supply and demand. The benchmarks provide the reference price for buying and selling. BARREL OF OIL EQUIVALENT The barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) is a term used to express the amount of energy equal to the energy in a barrel of oil", "ing. BARREL OF OIL EQUIVALENT The barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) is a term used to express the amount of energy equal to the energy in a barrel of oil. The BOE is used to report the amount of energy a company produces or has in reserves, as an alternative to other references such as barrels of oil or cubic feet of natural gas. MARKET DIFFERENTIALS Market differentials express the difference between benchmark prices. For example, the differential between Western Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western Canadian Select (WCS). The differential is the price difference that the oil from each supply chain commands in the marketplace. RAISING CAPITAL FOR OIL AND GAS The oil and gas sector is an integral part of the investment landscape in Canada. Oil and gas investments represent 20% of the value of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the largest source of private investment, with $74 billion invested in oil & gas in 2013. Oil and gas companies may employ a number of capital raising strategies in order to raise funds for exploration and development", "in oil & gas in 2013. Oil and gas companies may employ a number of capital raising strategies in order to raise funds for exploration and development. Companies at every level, from the super major to the private junior company, will consider participation sharing of some kind in order to raise capital for ventures. Venture sharing arrangements include the following: \u2022 Production Sharing and Participation Loans: The lender supplies capital for a specific venture and a portion of the cash flow from production is returned to the lender to service the debt and provide a share of the profit. \u2022 Joint Venture Agreement: Two or more companies enter into an arrangement and create a separate entity for a specific joint venture. The parties pool their resources and share financial commitments under the joint venture entity, separate and apart from their other businesses. \u2022 Farm-In Agreement: One company (the Farmor) engages a third party (the Farmee) in order to gain capital, expertise, and support for the development of a reserve.

INVESTING IN OIL AND GAS COMPANIES A diverse range of investment opportunities are available in the Canadian oil and gas industry including equities, debt financing, flow-through shares, and flow-through limited partnerships in both the public and private markets. When considering investment in the oil and gas industry, there are a number of factors to consider including: \u2022 play type \u2022 junior versus senior company LESSON 2 INVESTMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY 10 \u2022 13 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE PLAY TYPE The oil and gas industry will refer to a resource as a 'play' type. The factors that define the play are: \u2022 the type of commodity (oil, natural gas); and \u2022 the geology (the physical features of the reservoir) which impact extraction of the resource. Oil and gas play types fall into two categories, conventional or unconventional, as shown in the table below", "which impact extraction of the resource. Oil and gas play types fall into two categories, conventional or unconventional, as shown in the table below.

Other factors which affect the profitability of a petroleum company include: \u2022 oil and gas prices \u2022 the demand for oil and gas \u2022 unanticipated depletion of reserves \u2022 environmental hazards \u2022 safety hazards \u2022 political risks \u2022 native land claims \u2022 labour constraints \u2022 equipment failures JUNIOR COMPANY VERSUS SENIOR COMPANY When considering an investment in oil and gas, it is important to consider whether the investment relates to a junior company or a senior company. Junior companies are speculative investments focused on the exploration of reserves. Junior companies typically do not have a regular source of income and will not have records for earnings or dividends", "on the exploration of reserves. Junior companies typically do not have a regular source of income and will not have records for earnings or dividends. As such, the price of the offering will not be based on assets of the company but will be a price that has been negotiated by the issuer and the underwriter. Junior companies are focused on the exploration for possible reserves, however there is no assurance that exploration will be successful. It is not uncommon for a junior company to fail because capital has been depleted and exploration has not yielded a discovery of reserves. Junior companies are speculative investments and only those investors who are willing to risk 100% of their investment should consider these types of investments. VOLATILITY RISK AND CYCLICAL RETURNS Investors should be aware of the potential for considerable volatility in an oil and gas investment. Volatility can arise from rapid changes in commodity prices and the cyclical nature of the oil and gas sector. The securities of junior companies, in particular, are subject to drastic changes in price and volatility", "e cyclical nature of the oil and gas sector.

LESSON 2 INVESTMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY 10 \u2022 15 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE CONVENTIONAL PLAY VERSUS UNCONVENTIONAL PLAY It is important to consider whether the investment involves a conventional or unconventional play. For example, a conventional oil and gas opportunity likely exhibits a lower technical risk than a company deploying new and possibly unproven technology. Conventional drilling and production is also less capital intensive than unconventional recovery. POTENTIAL BENEFITS Investments in early-stage oil and gas exploration are speculative investments which will make most investors uneasy. While the risks are significant, there is the potential for attractive returns for the appropriate investor who has a high tolerance to risk and the willingness to speculate. An example of early-stage investment that was a resounding success is the oil sands development in Alberta.

Resources and Reserves Resource \u2022 Original resource: oil and gas which is estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations: \u2022 low estimate: conservative \u2022 best estimate: best \u2022 high estimate: optimistic \u2022 Original resource: \u2022 discovered \u2022 undiscovered \u2022 Discovered resource: oil and gas estimated from known accumulations \u2022 recoverable (ultimate reserve) \u2022 unrecoverable LESSON 3 SECURITIES REGULATION FOR OIL AND GAS INVESTMENTS 10 \u2022 21 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE Resources and Reserves \u2022 Undiscovered resource: oil and gas estimated to be in accumulations yet to be discovered: \u2022 recoverable \u2022 unrecoverable Reserve \u2022 Reserve: oil or gas which is anticipated to be economically recoverable from discovered resources \u2022 proved reserve: high degree of certainty to be recoverable \u2022 probable reserve: less certainty to be recoverable than proved reserve \u2022 possible reserve: less certainty to be recoverable than probable reserve Estimate \u2022 Proved: conservative \u2022 Proved + Probable: realistic \u2022 Proved + Probable + Possible: optimistic RES", "to be recoverable than probable reserve Estimate \u2022 Proved: conservative \u2022 Proved + Probable: realistic \u2022 Proved + Probable + Possible: optimistic RESERVE CATEGORIES Ultimately the value of reserves are tied to the value of the commodity (grade or quality) and the complexity of resource extraction. Reserves are classified into three categories: \u2022 proved (P1) \u2022 probable (P2) \u2022 possible (P3) Each category implies an increasing range of uncertainty and risk of recovery. METHODS TO ESTIMATE QUANTITY The quantity of reserves is estimated by volumetric method, material balance, or decline analysis. \u2022 Volumetric analysis: establishes rock porosity and fluid saturation of oil, gas, and water allowing for the calculation of an expected volume of production across the well or wells drainage area. \u2022 Material balance: considers the same factors as volumetric analysis with the added measure of reservoir pressure regimes in order to calculate potential production volumes. \u2022 Decline analysis: establishes the future anticipated rate of production over time and generally requires the benefit of historical production data", ". \u2022 Decline analysis: establishes the future anticipated rate of production over time and generally requires the benefit of historical production data. CONCLUSION Whether an oil and gas investment is offered by a reporting issuer by prospectus or by a private placement in the exempt market, it is important to have an understanding of the disclosures contained in the offering documents which pertain to the evaluation of oil and gas resources and oil and gas reserves.

WHAT IS A HEDGE FUND? The term \u201chedge fund\u201d is not defined in securities legislation. However, it is generally understood to refer to investment funds which share the following characteristics: \u2022 their objective is typically to generate absolute returns \u2022 they have broad investment mandates \u2022 the funds are privately distributed ABSOLUTE RETURN Hedge funds typically seek to generate positive returns in all market conditions. This is known as absolute return investing. This differs from traditional mutual funds which have relative return objectives. The characteristics of absolute return investing compared to relative return investing is summarized in the table below.

In contrast, hedge funds are not subject to the requirements of NI 81-102 and can therefore employ broad investment mandates without restrictions. A comparison of the investment mandates for mutual funds and hedge funds is summarized in the table below. Investment Mandate Conventional Mutual Funds Hedge Funds Strict limits on: \u2022 derivatives and alternative investments \u2022 short selling \u2022 concentration Prohibited from using: \u2022 leverage No restrictions or limits on: \u2022 derivatives and alternative investments \u2022 short selling \u2022 concentration \u2022 leverage PRIVATE DISTRIBUTION Traditional public mutual funds are distributed by prospectus and are subject to the continuous disclosure regime of reporting issuers. In contrast, hedge funds are offered under an exemption from prospectus requirements. As with all securities offered in the exempt market, hedge funds are distributed primarily by way of an offering memorandum (OM) and may only be purchased by certain investors who qualify for exemption (e.g", "ge funds are distributed primarily by way of an offering memorandum (OM) and may only be purchased by certain investors who qualify for exemption (e.g. accredited investor exemption, eligible investor under the offering memorandum exemption, etc.).

LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this lesson, you will be able to: 1 | Describe short selling. 2 | Describe leverage. 3 | Describe derivatives. 4 | Describe arbitrage. HEDGE FUND TRANSACTIONS The beginning of a hedge fund investment strategy starts with the financial transactions at its disposal. Hedge funds use transactions which are not available to traditional mutual funds including: \u2022 short selling \u2022 leverage \u2022 derivatives SHORT SELLING Short selling is carried out by a seller who sells a stock they do not own. The seller will short sell a stock with the expectation that the stock price will drop. When the stock price drops, the short seller will buy the stock on the market for less than it was sold for, thus making a profit from the difference in the price. When the stock is sold in the short sell, in order to deliver the stock to the buyer, the short seller will borrow it from an investment dealer. When the stock is bought, the short seller will give the stock to the investment dealer to \u201ccover\" the short position", "ow it from an investment dealer. When the stock is bought, the short seller will give the stock to the investment dealer to \u201ccover\" the short position. The impact of short selling is illustrated in the examples below. EXAMPLE Robert believes that the stock price of Goldblind Inc. is about to drop dramatically because the company\u2019s exploration efforts are going nowhere. He decides to sell 100 shares short at the current price of $50 per share. Six months later, the stock price drops to $45. Robert covers his short position and makes a profit of $500 in the process. Proceeds of short sale (100 shares \u00d7 $50) $5,000 Less: Purchase price (100 shares \u00d7 $45) $4,500 Profit $500 EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1111 \u2022 10 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXAMPLE Using the same scenario for Goldblind Inc. above, assume instead that the company strikes gold and the stock price rises to $100. Robert decides to cover his short position before the stock goes even higher. His loss is $9,500. Proceeds of short sale (100 shares \u00d7 $50) $5,000 Less: Purchase price (100 shares \u00d7 $100) $10,000 Loss $5,000 As this example illustrates, there is an asymmetry in short selling", "shares \u00d7 $50) $5,000 Less: Purchase price (100 shares \u00d7 $100) $10,000 Loss $5,000 As this example illustrates, there is an asymmetry in short selling. The best that can happen for the short seller is that the stock price drops to zero. The short seller\u2019s profit is therefore limited to the proceeds of the short sale. However, there is no limit to how high the stock price may rise. This means that the loss from a short position is potentially infinite. The ability to take short positions is very important to hedge funds for the following reasons: \u2022 short positions are essential to implement arbitrage strategies \u2022 short selling enables hedge funds to profit from overvalued stocks While short selling can be seen as a risky strategy, it can also be used to reduce the risk of a portfolio. A long-only portfolio is fully exposed to the risk of a market downturn. However, it is possible to manage this risk by means of short selling as a hedge (i.e. protection) against a market downturn. LEVERAGE Leverage means increasing a fund\u2019s investment exposure without increasing the money invested by the fund\u2019s investors", "ainst a market downturn. LEVERAGE Leverage means increasing a fund\u2019s investment exposure without increasing the money invested by the fund\u2019s investors. There are two ways to implement leverage: \u2022 borrowing, including buying on margin: The proceeds from the loan are used to buy additional investments, thereby increasing the fund\u2019s exposure \u2022 derivatives, such as options Leverage magnifies profits and losses as illustrated in the examples below. EXAMPLE The Investsafe Fund does not use leverage. Its portfolio has a net asset value of $100,000 and generates an 8% return. Gross return from the portfolio ($100,000 \u00d7 8%) 8,000 Net asset value of Investsafe Fund at beginning 100,000 Return of Investsafe Fund ($8,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 100%) 8% LESSON 2 HEDGE FUND TRANSACTIONS 11 \u2022 11 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXAMPLE The Levinvest Fund uses $1 of borrowing for every $1 of investors\u2019 money. Investors have invested $50,000, which represents the net asset value of the fund. The fund borrows an additional $50,000 at a rate of interest of 5%. The fund\u2019s portfolio is therefore $100,000 and is invested in exactly the same stocks as the Investsafe Fund, earning 8%", "at a rate of interest of 5%. The fund\u2019s portfolio is therefore $100,000 and is invested in exactly the same stocks as the Investsafe Fund, earning 8%. The return earned from the Levinvest Fund is 11%. Gross return from the portfolio ($100,000 \u00d7 8%) 8,000 Less: Interest on loan ($50,000 \u00d7 5%) (2,500) Net return 5,500 Net asset value of Leinvest Fund beginning 50,000 Return of Leinvest Fund ($5,500 \u00f7 $50,000 \u00d7 100%) 11% While leverage magnifies profits, the reverse is also true and leverage magnifies losses. If the return from the additional assets is lower than the interest rate on the loan, the fund will generate a lower return which could even be negative, possibly significantly so. EXAMPLE Using the same scenario for the Investsafe Fund and Levinvest Fund above, if the funds' portfolios were to each lose 8%, the return for the Investsafe Fund would be \u22128%. However, the return for the Levinvest Fund would be \u221221%", "the funds' portfolios were to each lose 8%, the return for the Investsafe Fund would be \u22128%. However, the return for the Levinvest Fund would be \u221221%. Gross return from the portfolio ($100,000 \u00d7 8%) (8,000) Less: Interest on loan ($50,000 \u00d7 5%) (2,500) Net return (10,500) Net asset value of Leinvest Fund beginning 50,000 Return of Levinvest Fund (($10,500) \u00f7 $50,000 \u00d7 100%) (21%) Often it is difficult to determine the level of leverage in a hedge fund investment because the level of leverage for each investment strategy within the hedge fund portfolio will be different. EXAMPLE An institutional investor allocates $100 million to a multi-strategy hedge fund, which allocates the funds between 20 traders: Trader A, who has a fixed income arbitrage strategy, receives a notional allocation of $50 million, leveraged 10 to 1 (i.e., $5 million times 10 times leverage). Trader A then levers up his $50 million in notional another 3 times by trading a $150 million portfolio. Trader B, who has a convertible arbitrage strategy, receives a notional allocation of $15 million, or is leveraged 3 to 1", "ng a $150 million portfolio. Trader B, who has a convertible arbitrage strategy, receives a notional allocation of $15 million, or is leveraged 3 to 1. Trader B then levers up his $15 million by a factor of 5 to 1 by trading a $75 million portfolio. And so on until all 20 traders have been allocated a notional amount of the $100 million investor capital. DERIVATIVES Derivatives are financial instruments which derive their values from an interest in an underlying asset (e.g. stocks, commodities, currencies, etc.). Derivatives include options, futures, forwards, and swaps. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1111 \u2022 12 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE For example, a call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset (e.g. a stock) at a given price, called the exercise price, within a given period known as the term. While the use of derivatives can be extremely risky when used to speculate, derivatives can also be used to reduce the risk of a portfolio. Such is the case when a covered call option is used as a hedge (i.e. protection) against a decline in the price of a long position", "isk of a portfolio. Such is the case when a covered call option is used as a hedge (i.e. protection) against a decline in the price of a long position. ARBITRAGE Arbitrage is used to earn profits when there are discrepancies between the prices of two related assets. EXAMPLE The stock price of Genbite Corp. on the TSX exchange is CA $52.55. At the same time, the stock price on the NYSE exchange is US $50. The currency exchange rate is US $1.00 = CA $1.05. Therefore: \u2022 The stock price on the NYSE is $52.50 Canadian \u2022 The stock price on the TSX is %52.55 Canadian The discrepancy for arbitrage is $0.05 Canadian. Arbitrage operates in the simplest of ways. The asset is bought on the market where it is cheaper and simultaneously sold where it is higher. Arbitrage margins are typically very slim and they are also fleeting. Once arbitrageurs begin taking advantage of an opportunity, they very quickly eliminate the price discrepancy. There are also instances where there is only the appearance of a discrepancy. Once transaction costs are taken into account, there may not be any arbitrage opportunity. Arbitrage is a way to exploit market inefficiencies", "epancy. Once transaction costs are taken into account, there may not be any arbitrage opportunity. Arbitrage is a way to exploit market inefficiencies. Typically, the inefficiencies are very small. In order to enhance the return from arbitrage strategies, hedge funds often use leverage. \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE 3 CONTENT AREAS Investment Strategy Categories Relative-Value Strategies Event-Driven Strategies Opportunistic Strategies Investment Risk Depends on the Investment Strategy Hedge Fund Investment Strategies LESSON 3 HEDGE FUND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES 11 \u2022 15 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE INTRODUCTION In this lesson, you will learn about hedge fund investment strategies.

CONVERTIBLE ARBITRAGE Convertible bonds provide the holder with the option to convert the bonds into common shares of the issuer at a specified conversion price", "E ARBITRAGE Convertible bonds provide the holder with the option to convert the bonds into common shares of the issuer at a specified conversion price. When the convertible bond is originally issued, the conversion price to common shares is higher than the market price of the shares. At that point, conversion is unprofitable or \"out of the money\" because it is cheaper to buy the shares on the market than to convert. However, if the share price increases to a point where it exceeds the conversion price, conversion would be profitable or \"in the money\"", "n to convert. However, if the share price increases to a point where it exceeds the conversion price, conversion would be profitable or \"in the money\". When using convertible arbitrage, the hedge fund: \u2022 buys the convertible bonds; and \u2022 short sells the common shares If the price of the shares go up, the hedge fund will: \u2022 cover the short position at a higher price and lose money on the short sale \u2022 make a gain on the increased price of the convertible bonds \u2022 the gain will offset the loss \u2022 the hedge fund achieves a return from the interest paid on the convertible bond If the price of the shares go down, the hedge fund will: \u2022 cover the short position at a lower price and make a gain on the short sale \u2022 take a loss on the decreased price of the convertible bonds \u2022 the gain will offset the loss \u2022 the hedge fund achieves a return from the interest paid on the convertible bond LESSON 3 HEDGE FUND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES 11 \u2022 17 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE The convertible arbitrage strategy provides a hedge (i.e. protection), whether the market goes up or down, and achieves a return from the interest paid on the convertible bonds", "strategy provides a hedge (i.e. protection), whether the market goes up or down, and achieves a return from the interest paid on the convertible bonds. The profit margin from this strategy is usually very thin. In order to achieve a reasonable return, hedge funds which use this strategy often use leverage to enhance the return. FIXED INCOME ARBITRAGE Fixed income arbitrage is a strategy which seeks to profit from price anomalies between related interest rate securities. The hedge fund assumes opposing long and short positions to take advantage of the price discrepancies while hedging against interest rate risk. Fixed income arbitrage includes interest rate swap arbitrage, government bond arbitrage, forward yield curve arbitrage, and combinations of each. The profit margin from this strategy is typically small and hedge funds commonly use leverage to enhance return. EQUITY MARKET-NEUTRAL The goal of the equity market-neutral strategy is to generate returns regardless if the market goes up or down. Long and short equity portfolios of relatively the same size, sector, and market capitalization, etc. are matched against each other within the hedge fund portfolio", "equity portfolios of relatively the same size, sector, and market capitalization, etc. are matched against each other within the hedge fund portfolio. As such, the portfolio is hedged against the market. The premise of the strategy is: \u2022 in rising markets: long positions will rise more in price than short positions \u2022 in falling markets: short positions will fall more in price than long positions Hedge funds commonly use leverage to enhance the return of a market-neutral strategy. EVENT-DRIVEN STRATEGIES Event-driven strategies seek to profit from a corporate event such as mergers or financial difficulties. MERGER ARBITRAGE The objective of the merger arbitrage strategy is to profit from the price differentials of companies in proposed mergers and acquisitions. When a company makes an offer to acquire a target company, the share price of the target company typically rises and the share price of the acquiring company typically declines. The offer can be made in cash, in shares, or a combination of both. CASH OFFER When a merger/acquisition offer is made in cash, the acquiring company will set a fixed price for the target company", "a combination of both. CASH OFFER When a merger/acquisition offer is made in cash, the acquiring company will set a fixed price for the target company. The stock of the target company will typically trade at a lower price than the offer price because the market will price in a discount to account for the risk of the merger not going through. The hedge fund will purchase the shares of the target company and hold the position until the deal is complete. When the merger is complete, the hedge fund will exchange the shares for cash and retain the profit from the price between the discount price and the offer price. SHARE OFFER When the offer is made in shares, in whole or in part, the hedge fund will: \u2022 buy the shares of the target company long \u2022 sell the shares of the acquiring company short EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1111 \u2022 18 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE Again, the objective is to profit from the price differential between the offer price and the discounted market price of the target company as illustrated in the example below. EXAMPLE Predator Inc. makes an offer to buy Prey Corp. for 2 shares of Predator Inc. for every 1 share of Prey Corp", "illustrated in the example below. EXAMPLE Predator Inc. makes an offer to buy Prey Corp. for 2 shares of Predator Inc. for every 1 share of Prey Corp. The shares of Predator Inc. trade at $25. Therefore, the implied offer price for Prey Corp. is $50 (2 \u00d7 $25). The shares of Prey Corp. are trading at $43 in the market. The Hedgebest Fund: \u2022 buys 1 share of Prey Corp. for $43 \u2022 sells short 2 shares of Predator Inc. for $50 The offer is accepted and the merger is completed. The Hedgebest Fund: \u2022 tenders its 1 share of Prey Inc. for 2 shares of Predator Inc. \u2022 uses the 2 shares of Predator Inc. to cover the short position The profit is $7: Short sale of two shares of Predator (2 shares \u00d7 $25) $50 Purchase of one share of Prey (tender) $43 Profit $7 The main risk of the merger arbitrage strategy is that the merger or acquisition is not completed, in which case the share price of the target company will typically drop and the hedge fund will lose money on its long position in the target company. The hedge fund could also lose money on its short position in the acquiring company if the shares increase in price for whatever reason (e.g", "company. The hedge fund could also lose money on its short position in the acquiring company if the shares increase in price for whatever reason (e.g. investors thought the acquiring company's offer for the target was too high). As such, success in event-driven investing depends on the ability to analyze the event and predict its outcome, not on market conditions in general. DISTRESSED SECURITIES Distressed securities are another form of event-driven investing. Distressed investing involves buying the bonds and sometimes the shares of companies which are in financial distress including: \u2022 companies that have defaulted on their obligations (e.g. have not paid interest on a bond on the due date, have not repaid the principal of a bond on the maturity date) \u2022 companies in bankruptcy \u2022 companies in creditor protection As there are relatively few buyers for companies in distress, it is often possible to buy distressed securities at favourable prices. Where the company succeeds in restructuring its operations and its financial condition, the price of the bonds will rise and the hedge fund will make a profit", "e company succeeds in restructuring its operations and its financial condition, the price of the bonds will rise and the hedge fund will make a profit. Where the restructuring is unsuccessful and the company is wound up, the hedge fund may still make a profit depending on the price it paid for the bond and the size of any liquidation distributions. Creditors such as bondholders must be repaid in full before any money may be paid to the shareholders. For these reasons, hedge funds in distressed investing are sometimes characterized as vulture funds. LESSON 3 HEDGE FUND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES 11 \u2022 19 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE The risks of distressed investing are significant and success depends on the ability to analyze the situation and predict its eventual outcome including: \u2022 the viability of the underlying business \u2022 its break-up value \u2022 the availability of fresh capital Some vulture funds actively attempt to influence the outcome of the restructuring. This may have contributed to the reputation of hedge funds as somewhat frightening entities. Other funds adopt a more passive approach", "restructuring. This may have contributed to the reputation of hedge funds as somewhat frightening entities. Other funds adopt a more passive approach. OPPORTUNISTIC STRATEGIES Opportunistic strategies seek to profit from exploiting opportunities identified in the markets. LONG/SHORT EQUITY In the long/short equity strategy, the hedge fund judges which stocks are undervalued and which stocks are overvalued and then: \u2022 buys the undervalued stocks long \u2022 sells the overvalued stocks short The hedge fund expects that the market will at some point recognize the fair value of the stocks and: \u2022 the price of the undervalued stocks will rise to their fair value \u2022 the price of the overvalued stocks will drop to their fair value If the price of the undervalued stocks rise and the price of the overvalued stocks drop: The price of: \u2022 the undervalued stocks rise The hedge fund will: \u2022 make a gain on the long position The price of: \u2022 the overvalued stocks fall The hedge fund will: \u2022 make a gain on covering the short position Where the price of the undervalued stocks held long drop or the price of the overvalued stocks held short rise, the positions will be covered at a loss", "here the price of the undervalued stocks held long drop or the price of the overvalued stocks held short rise, the positions will be covered at a loss. However, the premise of the strategy is that, as the market recognizes the fair value of the stocks, the: \u2022 undervalued stocks will rise by more than overvalued stocks \u2022 undervalued stocks will drop by less than overvalued stocks The long/short equity strategy provides a hedge in comparison to a long-only strategy and the potential outcomes can be profitable irrespective of whether the market is flat, rising, or falling. As with other hedge fund strategies, leverage is commonly used to enhance the return. The hedge fund\u2019s return, however, depends on the portfolio manager's ability to distinguish overvalued stocks from undervalued stocks. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1111 \u2022 20 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE It is important to note that the portion of the portfolio in undervalued stocks held long may not be equal to the portion in overvalued stocks held short. Generally, hedge funds will have some exposure to the equity markets (e.g. 60% long in stocks and 30% short stocks)", "n in overvalued stocks held short. Generally, hedge funds will have some exposure to the equity markets (e.g. 60% long in stocks and 30% short stocks). Thus, the portfolio manager is also making a directional call on the stock market. Some implementations of the equity long/short strategy apply the same stock selection judgement but also seek to minimize the fund\u2019s exposure to the broad market. This can be done in two ways: \u2022 the hedge fund holds equal amounts in both long and short positions \u2022 the hedge fund makes both long and short investments so that the beta of the overall fund is as low as possible Both of these are referred to as \u201cequity hedge\u201d or \u201cmarket neutral\u201d strategies and the net exposure is zero. All of these strategies can be used within a region, sector, or industry. Some hedge fund managers will attempt to increase the return from long/short equity strategies by leveraging the long and short positions. The risks to the long/short equity strategy are twofold: The portfolio manager could be incorrect on the direction of the market and could be incorrect on stock selection", "g/short equity strategy are twofold: The portfolio manager could be incorrect on the direction of the market and could be incorrect on stock selection. GLOBAL MACRO Global macro strategies give the hedge fund wide discretion to seek investment opportunities across the globe and across all asset classes. A global macro trading strategy involves investing in equities, fixed-income, foreign exchange, and commodity markets around the world. Macro hedge fund managers focus on underlying macro- economic fundamentals in developing their investment strategies including monetary policy shifts, fiscal policy shifts, gross domestic product growth, and inflation. Macro hedge fund managers establish opportunistic long or short market positions to benefit from anticipated moves in the market. The hedge fund managers tend to make significant use of derivatives and leverage. EXAMPLE One of the most famous cases of successful global macro investing to date occurred when George Soros reputedly made $1 billion in profit by speculating against the British pound", "s of successful global macro investing to date occurred when George Soros reputedly made $1 billion in profit by speculating against the British pound. Soros and other speculators sold the British pound short based on his assessment that he believed the pound was overvalued when Britain entered the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Eventually, the British government withdrew from the ERM and the pound declined as a result. The strategy cemented Soros\u2019 reputation as one of the premier global macro hedge fund investors. Global macro investing risks are highly dependent on two factors, the macro-economic judgment of the hedge fund and the timing of the investment call. The macro hedge fund manager may be correct in his assessment of macro conditions, but the timing of the market strategies may be incorrect. Moreover, there may be a heavy degree of leverage involved in many macro trades, which also adds to the overall risks to the investors in a hedge fund using global macro strategies. MANAGED FUTURES Managed futures strategies are operated by specialist advisers (portfolio managers) known as commodity trading advisers (CTAs)", "tegies. MANAGED FUTURES Managed futures strategies are operated by specialist advisers (portfolio managers) known as commodity trading advisers (CTAs). CTAs invest in futures contracts; derivative instruments that are traded on a futures exchange which derive their price from the underlying asset such as a commodity, currency exchange rate, interest rate, etc. The parties to a futures contract agree to buy or sell an asset to be delivered at a specified future date at a pre-agreed price. LESSON 3 HEDGE FUND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES 11 \u2022 21 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXAMPLE Sweetreats Inc. agrees to buy a certain quantity of sugar to be delivered immediately at a price of 4 cents per pound. Since delivery is immediate, the price is known as the spot price. Sweetreats Inc. learns that the sugar cane crop in Brazil has failed and that sugar prices are likely to climb drastically. Sweetreats buys a futures contract which obligates it to buy a certain quantity of sugar to be delivered in three months\u2019 time at a price of 4.25 cents per pound. Since delivery is at a future date, the price is known as the forward price", "to be delivered in three months\u2019 time at a price of 4.25 cents per pound. Since delivery is at a future date, the price is known as the forward price. By buying the futures contract, Sweetreats has assured itself of a supply of sugar at a time when it knows that it will need it, at a known price. Managed futures hedge funds use futures contracts in their investment strategy. The futures contracts are bought long and sold short based on sophisticated technical and statistical analysis of the future price of the underlying assets. While many managed futures hedge funds focus on identifying \"long-term\" trends (six months to one year), other hedge funds have constructed models to predict short-term momentum and counter-trend price moves. Derivative instruments may be used by managed futures funds to leverage their portfolios. The risks of investing in futures contracts stem from the dependence on the hedge fund's abilities to project future markets for the underlying assets, compounded by the use of leverage to enhance returns. EMERGING MARKETS Emerging markets are another form of opportunistic investing", "underlying assets, compounded by the use of leverage to enhance returns. EMERGING MARKETS Emerging markets are another form of opportunistic investing. The investment strategy involves investing in emerging market countries including those of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and South Korea, Mexico, Indonesia, and Turkey. In order to profit from growth opportunities in those countries, the hedge fund will invest in emerging market debt, the equities of companies in emerging markets, the equities of companies exposed to emerging market economies, or the currencies of emerging market countries. Hedge funds can profit from high growth opportunities or from inefficiencies in markets that are not as well researched as developed markets. Liquidity and market capitalization in these markets can be very limited, short term capital flows tend to be volatile, and the governments in some emerging countries have periodically imposed structural impediments to short selling. The net result is that most emerging market managers tend to have a long bias to equities", "eriodically imposed structural impediments to short selling. The net result is that most emerging market managers tend to have a long bias to equities. To be successful, hedge funds in emerging markets must possess a strong understanding of the macro-economic environment to determine if the market has mispriced the currency, the default risk on a bond, or the growth potential of a stock. Leverage is commonly used to enhance the return on emerging market portfolios. The risks of investing in emerging markets are twofold: The dependency on the hedge fund's macro-economic judgment and its judgment on the selection of the portfolio's holdings. INVESTMENT RISK DEPENDS ON THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY From an investment perspective, while hedge funds may commonly be conceived of as highly risky strategies, this would be a misconception. The investment risk of a hedge fund depends on the investment strategy it employs. Certain relative-value and arbitrage strategies are relatively low risk. Many hedge funds performed very poorly in the bear market of 2008. This led some investors to question whether hedge funds truly generate absolute returns", "hedge funds performed very poorly in the bear market of 2008. This led some investors to question whether hedge funds truly generate absolute returns. Hedge funds encompass a wide variety of investment strategies. Many of them, such as arbitrage strategies, are premised on the objectives of generating positive returns irrespective of market conditions. However, there are also hedge fund strategies, including most opportunistic strategies, which are directional in nature. Success in directional investing depends on correctly predicting the direction of movements in the market. If the hedge fund's prediction turns out to be incorrect, the fund will lose money. The skill of the portfolio manager is paramount. Even investment strategies which are meant to deliver absolute returns in all market conditions can fail if applied incorrectly. \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE 4 CONTENT AREAS Overview of Risk and Return Statistical Risk Measures Risk-Adjusted Return Risk and Return LESSON 4 RISK AND RETURN 11 \u2022 25 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE INTRODUCTION In this lesson, you will learn about measuring the risk and return of hedge funds", "RISK AND RETURN 11 \u2022 25 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE INTRODUCTION In this lesson, you will learn about measuring the risk and return of hedge funds.

OVERVIEW OF RISK AND RETURN When measuring the return of a hedge fund, the assessment of the return should consider the risk that was assumed by the hedge fund in order to generate the return. Assessing the risk of a hedge fund will involve complex financial and statistical analysis. Financial analysis is based on data in the financial statements of an issuer to determine, among other things, its capital structure, liquidity, and profitability. Statistical risk analysis involves measures that are found in modern portfolio theory which are derived from the analysis of historical market data to analyze volatility and downside risk", "asures that are found in modern portfolio theory which are derived from the analysis of historical market data to analyze volatility and downside risk. STATISTICAL RISK MEASURES Two statistical measures that are commonly used as indicators of hedge fund risk are: \u2022 maximum drawdown \u2022 time under water EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1111 \u2022 26 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE MAXIMUM DRAWDOWN Maximum drawdown is: \u2022 a measure of the maximum amount a hedge fund has lost historically \u2022 represented by the maximum drop in the net asset value (NAV) per unit from peak to trough EXAMPLE Hedgeinvest Fund\u2019s NAV per unit reaches a peak of $10, then drops and reaches a trough of $8, at which point it begins to recover. Figure 11.1 $12.00 $10.00 $10.00 $10.00 $8.00$8.00 $6.00 $4.00 $2.00 $0.00 Peak Trough Recovery Maximum Drawdown The loss from peak to trough is calculated as follows: $10 \u2212 $8 = $2 (20%) The maximum drawdown is 20% of the peak value. TIME UNDER WATER Time under water complements maximum drawdown as an indicator of risk", "\u2212 $8 = $2 (20%) The maximum drawdown is 20% of the peak value. TIME UNDER WATER Time under water complements maximum drawdown as an indicator of risk. Time under water: \u2022 measures the maximum time it takes for a hedge fund to recover its money after a loss \u2022 represents the maximum time it takes after a drop from a peak, to recover to the level of the peak LESSON 4 RISK AND RETURN 11 \u2022 27 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXAMPLE Hedgeinvest Fund\u2019s NAV per unit drops from $10 to $8 in 2 days and then it takes 16 days for the price to recover back to $10. Figure 11.2 Price $12.00 $10.00 $8.00 $6.00 $4.00 $2.00 $0.00 Days Time Under Water 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 The time under water is 18 days. When used together, the maximum drawdown and the time under water give a useful statistical indication of a hedge fund\u2019s risk. RISK-ADJUSTED RETURN A risk-adjusted return is a measure of return which has been adjusted to consider the fund\u2019s risk. It makes it possible to compare two funds with different degrees of risk. EXAMPLE Fund A has a return of 10%. Fund B has a return of 12%. Which fund did better? It is impossible to say because there is insufficient data", "isk. EXAMPLE Fund A has a return of 10%. Fund B has a return of 12%. Which fund did better? It is impossible to say because there is insufficient data. The data is not sufficient because the two funds may have different risk levels. If a fund achieves a higher return because of higher risk, this is not necessarily a good thing because the fund\u2019s incremental return may not compensate for its incremental risk. Risk-adjusted return encompasses two elements: \u2022 the risk-free rate \u2022 statistical risk measures EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1111 \u2022 28 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE RISK-FREE RATE The risk-free rate is the return obtained from investing in a risk-free asset. A risk-free asset is an asset whose return is certain. In practice, a Government of Canada treasury bill is often used as a proxy for a risk-free asset because the risk of default is so low that it can be ignored for most practical purposes. STATISTICAL RISK MEASURES Two commonly used statistical measures of risk are: \u2022 standard deviation \u2022 beta STANDARD DEVIATION Standard deviation is a measure of the variability of an asset\u2019s price or returns", "measures of risk are: \u2022 standard deviation \u2022 beta STANDARD DEVIATION Standard deviation is a measure of the variability of an asset\u2019s price or returns. Here, risk is equated with variability from the mean (or volatility). If the prices/returns are further from the mean, there is a higher deviation; thus, the more spread out the prices/returns, the higher the standard deviation. EXAMPLE Stocks M and N both have an expected return of 10%. The standard deviation of stock M is 2% and that of stock N is 4%. The returns of stock N are more variable from the mean (or volatile) than those of stock M. Stock N is therefore riskier than stock M. BETA The beta of an asset measures how its return responds to changes in the return of the market as a whole. A broad- based index such as the S&P/TSX Composite is often used as a proxy for the market. The beta of the market is 1. EXAMPLE Stock E has a beta of 1. This means that its return moves in tandem with that of the market. If the market return goes down by 10%, the return of stock E will also go down by 10%. Stock E has the same risk as the market. Stock F has a beta of 0.8", "the market return goes down by 10%, the return of stock E will also go down by 10%. Stock E has the same risk as the market. Stock F has a beta of 0.8. This means that if the market return goes up or down by 10%, its return will go up or down by 8%, or 0.8 \u00d7 10%. Stock F is less risky than the market. Stock G has a beta of 1.2. This means that if the market return goes up or down by 10%, its return will go up or down by 12%, or 1.2 \u00d7 10%. Stock G is riskier than the market. RISK-ADJUSTED RETURN MEASURES An investor who invests in a risk-free asset earns the risk-free rate. To earn more than the risk-free rate, an investor must accept more risk. The risk of an asset can be measured by its standard deviation or by its beta. The greater the risk of the asset, the greater the excess of its expected return over the risk-free rate should be. This is the fundamental principal in analysing investment performance. Some common risk-adjusted return measures are: \u2022 the Sharpe ratio \u2022 the Treynor ratio \u2022 the Sortino ratio LESSON 4 RISK AND RETURN 11 \u2022 29 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE THE SHARPE RATIO The Sharpe ratio uses standard deviation as its measure of risk", "atio LESSON 4 RISK AND RETURN 11 \u2022 29 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE THE SHARPE RATIO The Sharpe ratio uses standard deviation as its measure of risk. It measures the asset\u2019s excess return per unit of risk, where risk is its standard deviation of return. Formula: Sharpe Ratio \u2212= pfp p RRS O Where: Sp = Sharpe ratio of the portfolio Rp = Return of the Portfolio Rf = Risk-Free Rate Op = Standard Deviation of the portfolio The higher the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, the better the risk adjusted return. A variant of the Sharpe ratio is the Information ratio in which the risk-free asset is replaced by a benchmark portfolio. THE TREYNOR RATIO The Treynor ratio uses beta as its measure of risk. It measures the asset\u2019s excess return per unit of risk, where risk is its beta. Formula: Treynor Ratio \u2212= pfp p RRT \u03b2 Where: Tp = Treynor ratio of the portfolio Rp = Return of the Portfolio Rf = Risk-Free Rate \u03b2p = Beta of the portfolio The higher the Treynor ratio of the portfolio, the better the risk adjusted return. THE SORTINO RATIO Both the Sharpe and Treynor ratios use statistical risk measures that encompass both the upside and downside volatility", "sted return. THE SORTINO RATIO Both the Sharpe and Treynor ratios use statistical risk measures that encompass both the upside and downside volatility. The Sortino ratio is the Sharpe ratio, with the difference being that it uses downside deviation (using only downside volatility), rather than standard deviation.

The principals of the investment fund manager usually invest their own money in the fund alongside other investors. This aligns their interests with those of outside investors. As part of the due diligence of a hedge fund, it would be prudent to check whether the principals have invested their own money in the fund and if so, how much. This would be a measure of their commitment to the fund and the strength of their conviction in their abilities. While the investment fund manager of any investment fund has wide discretionary powers, this is particularly true of hedge funds because they have broad investment mandates, are privately distributed, and are therefore less transparent than public investment funds. It is therefore essential to be fully confident in the integrity and competence of the investment fund manager and this should be a matter of focus in the due diligence process", "to be fully confident in the integrity and competence of the investment fund manager and this should be a matter of focus in the due diligence process.

This lesson takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this lesson, you will be able to: 1 | Understand how the taxation of a hedge fund depends on its legal form. 2 | Explain the tax treatment of hedge fund limited partnerships. 3 | Explain the tax treatment of hedge fund trusts. 4 | Discuss the SIFT rules with respect to hedge funds. TAX CONSIDERATIONS The tax considerations of any investment should be determined in consultation with a professional tax adviser. For information purposes, the general tax considerations in relation to hedge funds are outlined below. LEGAL STRUCTURE AND TAX TREATMENT Canadian hedge funds usually take one of two legal forms: \u2022 limited partnership \u2022 trust The legal structure of a hedge fund will dictate its treatment from a tax perspective. HEDGE FUND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS Hedge fund limited partnerships do not pay taxes on income. Like any other limited partnership, they are flow- through entities and as such, income and losses from the limited partnership flow-through to its limited partners (i.e", "ted partnership, they are flow- through entities and as such, income and losses from the limited partnership flow-through to its limited partners (i.e. the hedge fund unit holders). The unit holders receive the income generated by the limited partnership and then must report the income in their tax filings. If the limited partnership incurs a loss, these losses can also be deducted by the unit holders in their tax filings. The income and losses will flow through to the hedge fund unit holders in its original form, for example as: \u2022 interest \u2022 dividends \u2022 capital gains When a hedge fund investor redeems their hedge fund units, the capital gain or loss must be considered for tax purposes. The amount of the capital gain is the difference between the proceeds of disposition and the total of: \u2022 the adjusted cost base (ACB) of the units; and \u2022 the expenses incurred to dispose of the units. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1111 \u2022 42 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE HEDGE FUND TRUSTS The Income Tax Act (Canada) normally treats a trust as a separate taxpayer for income tax purposes. This means that any income earned by the trust will be taxed in the trust", "ada) normally treats a trust as a separate taxpayer for income tax purposes. This means that any income earned by the trust will be taxed in the trust. However, hedge funds can be structured to meet certain conditions in the Income Tax Act (Canada) which permit flow-through tax treatment to the hedge fund unit holders. As such, income that is earned through the trust and then paid to the hedge fund unit holders is taxed at only one level, to the unit holders. The hedge fund unit holders receive the income generated by the trust and then must report the income in their tax filings. Unlike limited partnerships, however, trusts may not distribute losses to the unit holders. The income will flow through to the hedge fund unit holders in its original form, for example as: \u2022 interest \u2022 dividends \u2022 capital gains There is nothing to prevent a trust from distributing more than its income. The excess is treated as a return of capital and is deducted from the adjusted cost base (ACB) of the units. A return of capital distribution is not taxable when it is paid to the investor. However, a capital gain (or loss) will be realized when the investor eventually redeems the units", "tion is not taxable when it is paid to the investor. However, a capital gain (or loss) will be realized when the investor eventually redeems the units. The capital gain will be greater (or the capital loss smaller) when a return of capital has been paid because the adjusted cost base was reduced. When a hedge fund investor redeems their hedge fund units, the capital gain or loss must be considered for tax purposes.

SIFT RULES The Specified Investment Flow-Through (SIFT) rules effectively eliminate the flow-through tax advantages on publicly-traded income trusts.

As such, hedge funds can employ broad investment mandates including buying long, selling short, using leverage to enhance return, concentration, and alternative investments including real estate, derivatives, commodities, and private equity. \u2022 Absolute returns: Hedge funds typically seek to generate positive returns, regardless of market conditions. This differs from traditional mutual funds which seek to generate positive returns relative to the market, indices, and benchmarks", "market conditions. This differs from traditional mutual funds which seek to generate positive returns relative to the market, indices, and benchmarks. \u2022 Diversification: Because hedge funds focus on absolute returns using broad investment mandates and alternative investments, there is a low correlation to traditional assets and the markets in general. Therefore, portfolios holding traditional assets which include hedge funds as a component can be better diversified and more efficient. \u2022 Risk adjusted returns: Hedge funds can employ a number of investment strategies which can \u201chedge\u201d (i.e. protect) against risk including relative value arbitrage and equity market-neutral strategies. Because hedge funds can buy long, sell short, and use derivatives, they can cover positions with long and short hedging strategies. As such, hedge funds can mitigate risks that long-only mutual funds cannot. \u2022 Tax treatment: The income earned by hedge funds is flowed through to the unit holders and is taxed at one level only (i.e. double tax is avoided), whether structured as a limited partnership or trust", "s flowed through to the unit holders and is taxed at one level only (i.e. double tax is avoided), whether structured as a limited partnership or trust. In addition, hedge funds structured as limited partnerships can also flow losses through to the unit holders. \u2022 Professional management: Hedge funds are typically professionally managed portfolios. \u2022 Registered plans: Hedge funds can be eligible for registered plans such as RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs, RESPs, and RDSPs depending on the legal structure of the hedge fund (e.g. trust). \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE 8 CONTENT AREAS Hedge Fund Fees Hedge Fund Fees LESSON 8 HEDGE FUND FEES 11 \u2022 49 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE INTRODUCTION In this lesson, you will learn about the fees for hedge funds.

HEDGE FUND FEES Hedge fund fees include the following two fees: \u2022 a management fee \u2022 a performance fee The size of the fees depends on the following factors: \u2022 whether the hedge fund is a single-manager or a fund-of-funds/multi-manager (FOF) hedge fund \u2022 the series of the fund unit Hedge funds are generally available in several series of units, in recognition of the fact that different investors have different compensation arrangements with their dealers. The most common classes of hedge fund units are: \u2022 Series A units: purchased by investors with commission-based dealer accounts \u2022 Series F units: purchased by investors with fee-based dealer accounts The forms of dealer compensation for hedge funds are similar to those in the mutual fund industry. SINGLE-MANAGER HEDGE FUND FEES The typical management and performance fees for a single-manager hedge fund are summarized in the table below", "industry. SINGLE-MANAGER HEDGE FUND FEES The typical management and performance fees for a single-manager hedge fund are summarized in the table below.

The hedge fund charges the investors lower management fees and does not pay asset-based commissions (i.e. trailer commissions) to the dealers. The management fees not charged to the Series F unit investors is offset by the trailer commissions not paid to the dealers for their Series F unit clients", "anagement fees not charged to the Series F unit investors is offset by the trailer commissions not paid to the dealers for their Series F unit clients. PERFORMANCE FEES There are 3 main factors to consider when analysing a hedge fund\u2019s performance fee: \u2022 over what period the performance fee is calculated \u2022 hurdle rate \u2022 high-water mark The important factors of performance fees are outlined in the table below.

EXAMPLE Hedgeinvest Fund starts at a NAV per unit of $100. At the end of period 1, the NAV per unit is $120: The hedge fund is entitled to a performance fee of 20% of the $20 profit per unit. At the end of period 2, the NAV per unit is $105: The hedge fund is not entitled to a performance fee. At the end of period 3, the NAV per unit is $115: The hedge fund is not entitled to a performance fee. At the end of period 4, the NAV per unit is $130: The hedge fund is entitled to a performance fee of 20% of the $10 profit ($130 \u2212 $120 = $10). The new watermark is $130. LESSON 8 HEDGE FUND FEES 11 \u2022 51 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE When analysing a high-water mark, it is only the NAV per unit that matters, not the NAV of the fund. The NAV of the fund includes subscriptions and redemptions which have no bearing on performance. It is also important to ascertain whether the high-water mark is permanent or reset at periodic intervals. High-water marks that are permanent or reset periodically each have different advantages as illustrated in the table below", "eset at periodic intervals.

The primary service a FOF hedge fund provides is selection of the underlying hedge funds. As such, this implies that the FOF hedge fund should not earn a performance fee if the FOF hedge fund collectively has poor performance. It is therefore important to determine how performance fees are calculated: \u2022 based on the collective performance of the FOF hedge fund as a whole; or \u2022 based on each underlying hedge fund in the portfolio If the performance fee is based on the latter, the FOF hedge fund can earn performance fees even when the FOF hedge fund is losing money overall", "folio If the performance fee is based on the latter, the FOF hedge fund can earn performance fees even when the FOF hedge fund is losing money overall. \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE 9 CONTENT AREAS Risks of Hedge Funds Other Issues Management Expense Ratios Back-Tested Data Side Letters Due Diligence Risks of Hedge Funds LESSON 9 RISKS OF HEDGE FUNDS 11 \u2022 55 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE INTRODUCTION In this lesson, you will learn about the risks of hedge funds and other issues related to hedge funds.

RISKS OF HEDGE FUNDS There are certain risks associated with hedge funds. The most apparent risks commonly associated with hedge funds are summarized below", "OF HEDGE FUNDS There are certain risks associated with hedge funds. The most apparent risks commonly associated with hedge funds are summarized below. \u2022 Investment Risk: Hedge funds are subject to investment risks over and above those encountered in traditional investing including the following: \u2022 The use of derivatives can result in severe losses of very large amounts in a very short period of time. \u2022 Investment in alternative assets can result in severe losses and some assets can be particularly illiquid or difficult to sell. \u2022 Leverage Risk: The use of leverage exposes the hedge fund to risks which include the following: \u2022 Leverage strategies can result in severe losses when the interest on the loan exceeds the return on the investment. \u2022 Leverage using margin loans can result in margin calls and if the margin calls are not covered, the assets could be sold out at an inopportune time at unfavourable prices. \u2022 The payment of interest and principal on leverage obligations must be satisfied regardless of returns or even losses", "ne time at unfavourable prices. \u2022 The payment of interest and principal on leverage obligations must be satisfied regardless of returns or even losses. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1111 \u2022 56 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE \u2022 Liquidity Risk: Hedge funds are exposed to liquidity risk in the following two ways: \u2022 Liquidity of the hedge fund units: Hedge funds typically have lock-up periods when the units cannot be redeemed. At the end of the lock-up period, there may also be limited redemption opportunities. Hedge funds typically require investors to notify the fund in advance of redemption requests, for example 30 days prior. In circumstances of adverse market conditions, hedge funds can suspend redemptions all together. Where redemption requests are honored, delays in the payment of the redemption proceeds may occur. In particular, fund-of-funds (FOF) hedge funds often withhold a portion of the redemption proceeds until sometime after the year-end when the financial statements of the underlying funds have been finalized. \u2022 Liquidity of the hedge fund\u2019s underlying investments: Hedge funds invest in alternative investments using complex investment strategies", "n finalized. \u2022 Liquidity of the hedge fund\u2019s underlying investments: Hedge funds invest in alternative investments using complex investment strategies. Therefore, some assets can be particularly illiquid and some positions can be particularly difficult to unwind. \u2022 Concentration Risk: Hedge funds are not subject to the requirements of National Instrument 81-102 (NI 81-102) concerning concentration restrictions. As such, hedge funds can be concentrated in a certain investment, sector, geographic region, etc. These high correlations reduce diversification and increase risk from concentration. \u2022 Counterparty Risk: Since hedge funds use derivatives in their investment strategies, this exposes them to counterparty risk: the risk that the party on the other side of the contract will default on their obligations. \u2022 Portfolio Manager Risk: Hedge funds employ investment strategies which often do not correlate to the performance of the market and in some circumstances take an opposite position to traditional investing. Therefore, the performance of a hedge fund is more focused and dependent on the portfolio manager's skill in applying a given investment strategy", "ing. Therefore, the performance of a hedge fund is more focused and dependent on the portfolio manager's skill in applying a given investment strategy. \u2022 Exempt Market Risks: Hedge funds are privately distributed under exemptions from prospectus requirements which poses risks from the following elements: \u2022 Transparency: Hedge funds are not subject to the reporting issuer regime, they provide less information to their investors, and the information provided is not subject to the oversight of the regulators. Not every hedge fund will reveal their portfolio. This lack of transparency often makes it difficult to ascertain whether the hedge fund is actually doing what it says it will do (i.e. whether it is adhering to its investment mandate, risk control process, trading discipline, and compliance processes). \u2022 Independent Review Committee: There is no Independent Review Committee (IRC) for a hedge fund. \u2022 Resale Restrictions: The resale restrictions for hedge funds are most commonly indefinite, which means that there is no secondary market for the hedge fund units", "rictions: The resale restrictions for hedge funds are most commonly indefinite, which means that there is no secondary market for the hedge fund units. Therefore, the only means of liquidity for investors would be redemption through the hedge fund which, in most cases, is also subject to restrictions and limitations. \u2022 Investor Rights: Investors in hedge funds are not afforded the same legal rights that are available to investors who purchase prospectus-based investment funds. The right of action for damages for a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d are limited in comparison to prospectus-based investment funds", "ectus-based investment funds.

In order to implement controls, many hedge funds outsource the valuation of their portfolio to a third-party administrator. This may not fully address the conflict if the administrator seeks involvement from the hedge fund in the valuation process", "third-party administrator. This may not fully address the conflict if the administrator seeks involvement from the hedge fund in the valuation process. However when structured properly, the conflict of interest can be addressed, if not entirely eliminated. ACCURACY OF ASSET PRICES IN A HEDGE FUND The value of a hedge fund is determined based on the prices of its underlying assets and positions. Issues of concern can arise with respect to the accuracy of the asset prices within a hedge fund. Certain assets are hard to price because they are illiquid or because there is a lack of external pricing sources. While some assets, for example those in long/short equity strategies, can be straight forward from a pricing perspective, others involving alternative investments and complex strategies will pose difficulties in valuation. FUND-OF-FUNDS/MULTI-MANAGER (FOF) HEDGE FUNDS Issues of concern can arise with respect to the valuation of fund-of-funds and multi-manager (FOF) hedge funds. The FOF hedge fund relies on the prices provided by the underlying hedge funds", "to the valuation of fund-of-funds and multi-manager (FOF) hedge funds. The FOF hedge fund relies on the prices provided by the underlying hedge funds. The FOF hedge fund does not always take independent steps to ensure that the prices of the underlying hedge funds are fairly valued. This leaves the fund open to the possibility of mispricing. MANAGEMENT EXPENSE RATIOS The fees and expenses of a hedge fund are invisible to the investor because they are deducted from the fund\u2019s assets before the net asset value (NAV) per unit is determined. The investor does not pay for the expenses separately, they are included in the NAV per unit of the hedge fund. However, hedge funds are privately distributed and are therefore not subject to the requirements in National Instrument 81-106 (NI 81-106) concerning the calculation and reporting of management expense ratios (MERs). Therefore, the availability of MER information may be limited and where provided, it may be open to errors or omissions. BACK-TESTED DATA When a hedge fund has a limited track record, it may present back-tested performance data in their marketing literature", "or omissions. BACK-TESTED DATA When a hedge fund has a limited track record, it may present back-tested performance data in their marketing literature. These are returns which would have been obtained in past periods prior to the creation of the hedge fund, if the fund\u2019s investment strategy had been applied during those periods. Back-tested data can be helpful in evaluating the sources of the hedge fund strategy\u2019s returns to ensure they are robust and repeatable, if the method of calculation is disclosed and the data has been validated by an independent source. However, back tested data can also be misleading because the results are hypothetical and may not be indicative of how the hedge fund will actually perform in the future", "d data can also be misleading because the results are hypothetical and may not be indicative of how the hedge fund will actually perform in the future.

These requirements are established in the securities regulations of the provincial securities regulators and the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) including: \u2022 National Instrument 45-106 (NI 45-106) \u2022 Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) Rule 45-501 \u2022 Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) Staff Notice 33-735 EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1212 \u2022 8 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE \u2022 Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) Staff Notice 33-315 \u2022 Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) Staff Notice 31-336 These instruments are designed to protect those investors who lack the sophistication or means to invest in the private market and a failure to properly qualify an investor can result in the regulators unwinding the transaction and taking serious disciplinary measures against you and your exempt market dealer (EMD)", "vestor can result in the regulators unwinding the transaction and taking serious disciplinary measures against you and your exempt market dealer (EMD). PREMISE FOR QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS The exempt market exists to provide small private issuers with a cost-effective and efficient market to raise capital. As a result, these private issuers are not subject to the requirements of the reporting issuer regime; they are less transparent; they are subject to less oversight by the regulators; and they provide less protection for investors with respect to statutory rights and disclosure. This makes exempt securities higher risk and not appropriate for most investors. Therefore, under the exempt market regime, only certain investors, namely those with more sophistication and means to withstand loss, are eligible to invest in exempt securities. SEPARATE PROCESS FROM KYC The process for determining whether a client qualifies to purchase an exempt product is a separate process from the Know Your Client (KYC) process. While some of the information on the KYC form (e.g", "lifies to purchase an exempt product is a separate process from the Know Your Client (KYC) process. While some of the information on the KYC form (e.g. income, net worth, occupation) may be useful, KYC forms do not collect enough information to support the availability of an exemption. For example, the accredited investor exemption requires that you determine the client\u2019s \u201cfinancial assets\u201d which is different than the client\u2019s net worth. Financial assets would include investments and cash, but would not include non-financial assets and fixed assets such as real estate, automobiles, etc. Under requirements, you are also obligated to establish an investor\u2019s eligibility at the time of each transaction. This is mandated because a client\u2019s financial circumstances could change at any given time which could disqualify them from eligibility. For this reason, NI 45-106 requires that you qualify investors for eligibility for each transaction, at the time of the transaction", "from eligibility. For this reason, NI 45-106 requires that you qualify investors for eligibility for each transaction, at the time of the transaction. This is unlike the requirements for KYC obligations which do not dictate that KYC is updated for each transaction, but rather prescribes that KYC is updated periodically and at any time you become aware of a material change in the client\u2019s circumstances. You must be fully confident that the investor is eligible to invest in exempt securities and be confident that you can demonstrate the investor\u2019s eligibility before ever discussing the particulars of the investment with the investor.

NEW CLIENT APPLICATION FORM (NCAF) The KYC process starts with the New Client Application Form (NCAF), also referred to as the Know Your Client (KYC) Form, which must be completed for each new client account that is opened. Complete KYC information must be collected and considered when accounts are opened and before trades and subscriptions are executed. In cases of disputes, the KYC Form will customarily be reviewed by regulators and lawyers to ascertain whether you knew the client and recommended suitable investments. However, investigation into suitability disputes will go beyond the information that is collected on the KYC Form, specifically if the information on the form appears unreasonable given the client\u2019s circumstances", "d the information that is collected on the KYC Form, specifically if the information on the form appears unreasonable given the client\u2019s circumstances. In order to collect the necessary KYC information, most NCAF/KYC Forms include the following sections: \u2022 identification \u2022 personal circumstances \u2022 financial circumstances \u2022 investment needs and objectives \u2022 investment knowledge \u2022 risk profile \u2022 time horizon \u2022 asset allocation (the % of exempt securities as part of the client\u2019s portfolio) The NCAF/KYC Form should be completed, signed, dated, and then reviewed by the EMD. The client should receive a signed copy of the NCAF/KYC Form for their records. IDENTIFICATION Under the KYC obligation, you have a duty to establish the identity of each client. Where there is any cause for concern, you are required to make reasonable inquiries as to the reputation of the client. Under Companion Policy (CP) 31-103, s. 13.2, the regulators establish their expectations of EMDs and Dealing Representatives in their role as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d to the capital market", "31-103, s. 13.2, the regulators establish their expectations of EMDs and Dealing Representatives in their role as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d to the capital market.

Age is important for several reasons: \u2022 There is a legal age of majority in each province. Agreements, including the purchase of securities, entered into by people who are not of legal age may not be enforceable. \u2022 There are age restrictions for certain accounts, such as Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs) and Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs). \u2022 The client\u2019s age ties in closely with short, medium, and long-term financial goals. For instance, a 25-year-old man with 40 years until retirement will likely have different investment needs and objectives and risk profile than a man of 60 who is approaching retirement. LESSON 3 KNOW YOUR CLIENT 12 \u2022 27 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES The client\u2019s financial circumstances are a key component of the client\u2019s KYC information and includes those elements below", "UTE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES The client\u2019s financial circumstances are a key component of the client\u2019s KYC information and includes those elements below.

For example, clients who are retired and living on a fixed income will have different objectives than those in their high-income earning years. In addition, some clients may have cyclical jobs or may be paid by commission. In these cases, their income may vary dramatically from year to year. It is important to recognize the potential gaps in clients\u2019 income and work with them to meet both short-term liquidity needs and longer-term investment requirements. Occupation may have an impact on whether there is a reasonable expectation that the client is an eligible investor, accredited investor, or permitted client", "tion may have an impact on whether there is a reasonable expectation that the client is an eligible investor, accredited investor, or permitted client. INCOME Annual income is critical to assessing an individual\u2019s financial condition and can be an indicator of whether they can withstand volatility or loss. Generally, clients with a low income are expected to have a lower risk profile, a higher need to preserve their principal, and increased liquidity requirements because significant life events (losing a job, buying a house, etc.) may result in the need to depend on their investments. For example, if the client will depend on the income generated by their investments to live on, then their financial circumstances would likely not allow for exposure to the exempt market. It would also not be generally suitable for a client with a low income to be invested through a leveraging strategy. On the other hand, a client earning $100,000 from employment with a healthy net worth would likely be less affected by a loss", "h a leveraging strategy. On the other hand, a client earning $100,000 from employment with a healthy net worth would likely be less affected by a loss. Asking the following questions can help determine the client\u2019s income: \u2022 What is your income and cash flow? \u2022 What are your sources of income? \u2022 Is your level of income consistent or does it vary? Income is commonly recorded in ranges on the KYC Form as illustrated below. Income \u2022 <$75K \u2022 $75,001 - $100K \u2022 $100,001 - $199,999 \u2022 $200K - $300K \u2022 >$300K EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1212 \u2022 28 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE From the perspective of income, the higher the income, the more likely the client will be suited for investment in the exempt market, assuming they are eligible to do so. Conversely, lower income would indicate that the client may not be suited for investment in these higher risk products. NET WORTH Net worth, along with other KYC factors including investment needs and objectives, income, and risk profile, is an important factor when considering whether an exempt security is appropriate for a client. Net worth should be calculated as the estimated liquid assets plus fixed assets less estimated liabilities", "xempt security is appropriate for a client. Net worth should be calculated as the estimated liquid assets plus fixed assets less estimated liabilities. Net worth should only include assets of the client and his or her spouse. Asking the following questions can help determine the client\u2019s net worth: \u2022 What is your net worth? \u2022 What are your fixed assets (e.g. residence, real estate)? \u2022 What are your liquid assets (e.g. cash, investments)? \u2022 What are your liabilities (e.g. mortgages, loans, credit cards)? \u2022 What are your outstanding tax obligations (e.g. taxes due)?

Conversely, lower net worth would indicate that the client may be suited for little or no investment in these higher risk products. LIQUIDITY Liquidity needs are an important aspect of a client\u2019s financial circumstances", "ted for little or no investment in these higher risk products. LIQUIDITY Liquidity needs are an important aspect of a client\u2019s financial circumstances. Ascertaining a client\u2019s liquidity needs includes determining: \u2022 the extent to which a client wishes or needs to access all or a portion of their investments to meet their ongoing and short-term expenses \u2022 financial obligations or major planned expenditures LESSON 3 KNOW YOUR CLIENT 12 \u2022 29 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE \u2022 whether the client has any other means to cover their expenditures \u2022 the frequency of any required withdrawals Extra caution should be exercised when dealing with clients who have a high need for liquidity given that highly liquid investment products are generally not available in the exempt market. LEVERAGE You are required to determine whether a client will use leverage or borrow to invest and collect and compute additional information about their financial circumstances in order to determine whether leverage will be suitable including: \u2022 net worth \u2022 liquid net worth \u2022 capacity (e.g", "about their financial circumstances in order to determine whether leverage will be suitable including: \u2022 net worth \u2022 liquid net worth \u2022 capacity (e.g. total debt service ratio (TDSR) and percentage of net worth (%NW)) The purpose of collecting this additional financial criteria is to assess the client\u2019s ability to meet debt obligations and to assess whether leveraged investing will be suitable for the client. INVESTMENT NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES The investment needs and objectives and risk profile of a client are the most critical criteria in assessing whether an investment product or investment strategy is suitable for a client. The client\u2019s investment needs and objectives define the ultimate goal that the client has for the invested capital and the result they aspire to achieve with the investment. Investment needs and objectives are often categorized as follows: Investment Needs and Objectives Safety Where a client\u2019s objective is safety, their goal is to preserve their capital and minimize volatility and the risk of losing money. The client should be willing to accept lower returns in order to reduce risk", "serve their capital and minimize volatility and the risk of losing money. The client should be willing to accept lower returns in order to reduce risk. Income Where a client\u2019s objective is income, their goal is to generate income from their investments and capital appreciation is not the primary requirement. Growth Where a client\u2019s objective is growth, their goal is capital appreciation and income from their investments is not a primary requirement. The client would generally have a medium to high risk profile. Speculation Where a client\u2019s objective is speculation, generally their goal is to generate higher returns from higher risk investments which generally have higher volatility. Clients can have multiple needs and objectives, for example, income and growth. In such cases, you are expected to help your clients define the relative importance of each objective. Most EMDs accommodate this by offering a KYC Form that allows the investment needs and objectives to be recorded in percentages. As set out in CP 31-103, s", "EMDs accommodate this by offering a KYC Form that allows the investment needs and objectives to be recorded in percentages. As set out in CP 31-103, s. 13.2, when determining a client\u2019s investment needs and objectives, the regulators expect you to provide clients with the opportunity to express their investment needs and objectives in non-technical terms that are meaningful to them, for example: \u2022 save for retirement \u2022 increase wealth by a certain percentage in a specific number of years EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1212 \u2022 30 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE \u2022 invest for the purchase of a home \u2022 invest for the post-secondary education of children The CP goes on to state: \u201cDepending on the nature of the relationship with the client, and the securities and services offered by the registrant, it may be appropriate to set out investment goals for a client\u2019s account or portfolio which may be done by developing an investment policy statement.

Where investment goals are agreed upon with a client, they should be set out in terms that are specific and measurable.

When determining suitability, you must compare the investment needs and objectives of the client and the features of the investment product or investment strategy to assess whether they align with each other. EXAMPLE Shane and Annabelle, a married couple in their mid-60s, are drawing a retirement income", "strategy to assess whether they align with each other. EXAMPLE Shane and Annabelle, a married couple in their mid-60s, are drawing a retirement income. Their priorities are to preserve capital and generate a regular income. Exempt securities are not geared towards capital preservation. On the other hand, their son Elliot is more inclined to invest for longer-term growth to build a pool of wealth for future financial needs. From the perspective of exempt securities, the more the client\u2019s investment needs and objectives are focused towards growth and speculation, the more likely they will be suited for investment in the exempt market, assuming they are eligible to do so. Conversely, investment needs objectives focused towards safety and preserving capital would indicate that the client may not be suited for investment in these higher risk products. For example, an exempt product in land development with a time horizon of 7 years or more would not be appropriate for a client saving to buy a house in 5 years or for a client seeking income and liquidity from the investment", "years or more would not be appropriate for a client saving to buy a house in 5 years or for a client seeking income and liquidity from the investment.

Specifically, you should be alert where investment knowledge flags inconsistencies with other KYC criteria, for example where a client indicates that they have limited investment knowledge and experience, but also indicate that they have a high-risk profile. Investment experience reflects how much investing the client has done previously and the nature and complexity of those investments. Investment experience is not the same as investment knowledge", "sting the client has done previously and the nature and complexity of those investments. Investment experience is not the same as investment knowledge. You cannot assume that because a client has previous investment experience that they have investment knowledge. Some clients may know a great deal about investing and various types of investments without ever having made investments. Other clients may know very little, despite having numerous previous investments. Investment experience is usually recorded on the KYC Form in a section where the client\u2019s previous investments can be listed or checked off using tick boxes. Investment knowledge is commonly recorded by selecting from a list of options on the KYC Form as illustrated below. Investment Knowledge Definition The client\u2019s knowledge about investments and investing Options \u2022 Novice (Low) \u2022 Fair (Average) \u2022 Good (Above Average) \u2022 Sophisticated (High) Becoming familiar with your client\u2019s level of investment knowledge helps you to determine the types of investments you might recommend", "sticated (High) Becoming familiar with your client\u2019s level of investment knowledge helps you to determine the types of investments you might recommend. Investment knowledge is a particularly important factor to consider when determining whether higher risk investment products such as exempt securities are appropriate for a client. The more complex or the higher the risk of the investment, the more sophisticated the client should be. RISK PROFILE When determining the suitability of an investment product or investment strategy for a client, perhaps the most important factor is the client\u2019s risk profile. Along with investment needs and objectives, risk profile is the most important key component of the client\u2019s KYC. Establishing a client\u2019s risk profile involves the determination of two (2) criteria: 1. The client\u2019s risk tolerance: the client\u2019s willingness to accept risk 2. The client\u2019s risk capacity: the client\u2019s ability to endure potential financial loss Risk tolerance and risk capacity are separate considerations that together make up the client\u2019s overall risk profile", "o endure potential financial loss Risk tolerance and risk capacity are separate considerations that together make up the client\u2019s overall risk profile. The client\u2019s risk profile should reflect: \u2022 the lower of: (1) the client\u2019s risk tolerance and (2) the client\u2019s risk capacity EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1212 \u2022 32 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE Assessing a client\u2019s risk capacity requires you to have an understanding about the client\u2019s personal and financial circumstances, investment needs and objectives, and other KYC criteria that would impact their ability to sustain investment losses. When assessing a client\u2019s risk capacity, you should consider the client\u2019s: \u2022 liquidity needs \u2022 debts \u2022 income \u2022 assets \u2022 the weighting of the client\u2019s investment(s) in relation to their overall financial position \u2022 age \u2022 life stage It is also important that you do not confuse risk profile with other KYC criteria such as income, net worth, and time horizon", "ition \u2022 age \u2022 life stage It is also important that you do not confuse risk profile with other KYC criteria such as income, net worth, and time horizon. While you should consider these criteria and discuss them with your clients to assist them in understanding risk and return, the criteria should not override the client\u2019s final assessment of their actual willingness and ability to accept risk. Consider, for example, a client who may be very affluent but loses sleep when his publicly listed stocks are volatile causing him to panic and sell at the wrong time. The regulators expect you to document the questions and answers you use to establish your clients\u2019 risk profiles. Assessing a client\u2019s risk profile is sometimes determined by using tools such as questionnaires. You should be fully aware of the questionnaires approved by your EMD and the firm\u2019s policies and procedures for determining risk profile. EMDs are expected to have definitions related to risk profile. The definitions for risk profiles will be established in the EMD\u2019s policies and procedures and Relationship Disclosure Information (RDI). Generally, the summary in the table below is true", "l be established in the EMD\u2019s policies and procedures and Relationship Disclosure Information (RDI). Generally, the summary in the table below is true. Risk Profile Low \u2022 means you cannot lose any part of your investment Medium \u2022 means you can risk losing part of your investment High \u2022 means you can risk losing your total investment It is important to note that exempt securities are unique in their lack of transparency and pricing information which creates the impression that the investments are not volatile. It is important not to equate this lack of visible volatility with lower risk. Private placement investments can sometimes result in a total loss of the client\u2019s investment without warning. It is therefore important to ask yourself if the client would be able to withstand such an event. With respect to real-estate based investments such as real estate investment trusts (REITs), mortgage investment corporations (MICs), and land development limited partnership units (LPUs), the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) has indicated that EMDs and Dealing Representatives are expected to discuss the potential risks associated with these products", "es Administrators (CSA) has indicated that EMDs and Dealing Representatives are expected to discuss the potential risks associated with these products. If you offer these exempt products, you are expected to discuss the risks inherent in these products such as the potential impact from a possible downturn in the real estate market or increased mortgage defaults by sub-prime borrowers. Like investment needs and objectives, risk profiles are often expressed in percentages which are recorded on the client\u2019s KYC Form/NAAF. From the perspective of exempt securities, the higher the risk profile, the more likely the client will be suited for investment in the exempt market, assuming they are eligible to do so. Conversely, a lower risk profile would indicate that the client may be suited for little or no investment in these higher risk products. LESSON 3 KNOW YOUR CLIENT 12 \u2022 33 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE Errors in correctly assessing a client\u2019s risk profile can result in significant ramifications including client complaints, enforcement proceedings, and legal action", "ectly assessing a client\u2019s risk profile can result in significant ramifications including client complaints, enforcement proceedings, and legal action. It is therefore important that you do not substitute your own judgment for that of your client when it comes to risk profile. If the client is not comfortable with a certain level of risk, the KYC should reflect that decision. RISK VERSUS RETURN CONFLICTS You should be aware that, in some cases, there will be a mismatch between the risk a client is willing or able to accept and the return the client expects. Higher expected returns come with inherently higher risk. Under these circumstances, you may be tempted to assess a higher risk profile than you should in an attempt to meet the client\u2019s return expectations. Resist this temptation. Where a client\u2019s desire for returns does not align with their risk profile, you are expected to follow prescribed steps to protect the client from assuming too much risk, as set out in CP 31-103, s. 13.2. Resolving conflicts between a client\u2019s expectations and risk profile As set out in CP 31-103, s", "uming too much risk, as set out in CP 31-103, s. 13.2.

The registrant should identify any mismatches between the client\u2019s investment needs and objectives, risk tolerance and capacity for loss. The questions at the source of this conflict should be revisited with the client. If a client\u2019s goals or return objectives cannot be achieved without taking greater risk than they are able or willing to accept, alternatives should be clearly explained such as saving more, spending less or retiring later. Where after discussion, it is determined that the client does not have the capacity or tolerance to sustain the potential losses and volatility associated with a higher risk portfolio, the registrant should explain to the client that their need or expectation for a higher return cannot realistically be met, and as a result, the higher risk portfolio is unsuitable", "to the client that their need or expectation for a higher return cannot realistically be met, and as a result, the higher risk portfolio is unsuitable. The interaction with the client and end results should be properly documented.\u201d TIME HORIZON Time horizon refers to the length of time the client will hold the investment before they will need to liquidate it and access the funds. Time horizon can range from short to long periods and will depend on the investor\u2019s individual objectives. Time horizon is customarily recorded in ranges on the KYC Form similar to the ranges in the table below. Time Horizon Definition The time from the purchase to the time when the client will need to access a significant portion of the money invested Options < 1 Year (Short-Term) 1 - 3 Years (Short-Term to Medium) 3 - 5 Years (Medium) 5<10 Years (Long) 10<20 Years (Very Long) 20+ Years (Very Long) EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1212 \u2022 34 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE A client\u2019s time horizon should be feasible and reasonable give the client\u2019s liquidity needs, age, investment needs and objectives, risk profile, and other KYC criteria", "orizon should be feasible and reasonable give the client\u2019s liquidity needs, age, investment needs and objectives, risk profile, and other KYC criteria. From the perspective of exempt securities, the longer the time horizon, the more likely the client will be suited for investment in the exempt market, assuming they are eligible to do so. Conversely, shorter time horizons would indicate that the client may not be suited for investment in these less liquid products. KYC CONSISTENCY WITH QUALIFICATION DOCUMENTS Where the client purchases exempt securities under the accredited investor exemption or as an eligible investor under the offering memorandum exemption, the documents supporting qualification of the client\u2019s eligibility must be consistent with the KYC documents. There should not be any discrepancies between the KYC Form and the eligibility documents (e.g. AI Certificate, Schedule 2 of the Risk Acknowledgement, etc.), and the documents should be reasonable given the client\u2019s circumstances.

CSA Staff Notice 31-336 provides the following example as guidance: \u201c...an investment in a high-risk security may be suitable for a client where the proposed investment would represent a small portion of the client\u2019s investment portfolio", "n a high-risk security may be suitable for a client where the proposed investment would represent a small portion of the client\u2019s investment portfolio. However, an investment in the same security may not be suitable for the client where the proposed investment would represent a substantial portion of the client\u2019s portfolio or where the proposed investment strategy involves leverage.\u201d You cannot, under any circumstances, delegate your suitability obligation to another party such as an unregistered individual, an administrative assistant, a referral agent, or a registrant at another firm. SUITABILITY DETERMINATION Under NI 31-103 and CP 31-103, you are required to satisfy a number of standards when making a suitability determination: 1. assess suitable options; 2. apply the \u201cClient\u2019s Interest First\u201d standard; and 3. document the basis for each suitability determination. ASSESSING SUITABLE OPTIONS Suitability determination starts with the identification and assessment of suitable options for a client. This involves the objective analysis of the KYC information for the client and the KYP information for the investment product or strategy", "or a client. This involves the objective analysis of the KYC information for the client and the KYP information for the investment product or strategy.

This risk-based approach is an effective starting point and there are also correlations that can be made by comparing the KYC and KYP information related to investment objectives, time horizon, age, and investment knowledge. While these elements are key in determining suitability, all aspects of the client\u2019s KYC, the investment\u2019s KYP, and the client\u2019s existing holdings need to be considered. As set out in CP 31-103, s. 13.3, suitability assessment: \u2022 cannot use the risk rating of a security as the only input in determining its suitability \u2022 cannot be determined only on a trade by trade basis Suitability assessment must encompass a portfolio approach in order to consider the impact of factors such as risk, concentration of investments, and liquidity in the client\u2019s portfolio. Where client accounts are held separately in multiple accounts (e.g", "ch as risk, concentration of investments, and liquidity in the client\u2019s portfolio. Where client accounts are held separately in multiple accounts (e.g. client name), and not in one portfolio, you are expected to consider how any recommendations or other investment actions in one account will materially affect the client\u2019s investments across all of their accounts. \u201cCLIENT\u2019S INTEREST FIRST\u201d STANDARD Following the assessment of suitable options for the client, you are then required to apply the \u201cClient\u2019s Interest First\u201d standard.

Examples of factors that might have such an influence include sales commissions, targets for sales volume or assets under management, client retention, and relationships with issuers. If any of these material conflicts of interest are present, the firm must have policies and procedures for addressing them as discussed above. Where material conflicts are present, they must be considered before any investment action is taken", "procedures for addressing them as discussed above. Where material conflicts are present, they must be considered before any investment action is taken. In that context, the test is whether the registrant has put the client\u2019s interest first.\u201d With respect to exempt market products, the FAQ goes on to state: \u201cIt also includes circumstances where a registrant has a limited product shelf. In some instances, a registrant will have to decline to provide a product or service to a client in order to put the client\u2019s interest first. For example, an EMD with a limited shelf might be unable (i) to conclude that any of its offerings are suitable for a client and (ii) put the client\u2019s interest first after taking into account the client\u2019s concentration in one security, sector or industry, high risk securities, or illiquid exempt market securities, or the direct and indirect costs, fees, commissions, charges, and registrant compensation which may be associated with their products, including embedded costs paid by the issuer", "osts, fees, commissions, charges, and registrant compensation which may be associated with their products, including embedded costs paid by the issuer. Registrants must document the reasonable basis for their suitability determinations, including how they have met their obligation to put the client\u2019s interest first.\u201d The obligation to put the client\u2019s interest first when determining suitability requires you to consider, amongst other factors, the potential (or actual) impact of costs on the client\u2019s return on investment. Costs include all direct and indirect costs, such as: \u2022 fees \u2022 commissions \u2022 charges \u2022 trailing commissions \u2022 any other costs associated with a proposed action You are expected to assess both the: \u2022 relative costs of the options available to clients \u2022 impact of those costs on the client\u2019s overall return from any compensation paid, directly or indirectly, to you As per the guidance in the CSA\u2019s Client Focused Reforms Frequently Asked Questions, s.47: \u201cThis requirement includes considering the impact of all direct and indirect costs which may be associated with a product, including embedded costs paid by the issuer", "t includes considering the impact of all direct and indirect costs which may be associated with a product, including embedded costs paid by the issuer. In this regard, it is not appropriate for registrants, including EMDs, to rely solely on forward looking information about the issuer\u2019s potential returns that is provided in the issuer\u2019s offering documents. Registrants, including EMDs, should perform their own assessment of the potential and actual impact of costs on the client\u2019s return on investment when making a suitability determination.\u201d Some investment products or strategies that are assessed to be suitable for a client, based on KYC and KYP, may not meet the \u201cClient\u2019s Interest First\u201d standard.

Davidson earned $15,346 in commissions by investing the client in the DSC version of the fund. In doing so, Davidson violated MFDA Rules 2.1.1 (Standard of Conduct), 2.1.4 (Conflicts of Interest), and 2.2.1 (Suitability)", "DSC version of the fund. In doing so, Davidson violated MFDA Rules 2.1.1 (Standard of Conduct), 2.1.4 (Conflicts of Interest), and 2.2.1 (Suitability). The Settlement Agreement was accepted by the MFDA Hearing Panel on July 12, 2021 and the following settlement terms were ordered: A one month prohibition, a fine of $22,500, and costs of $5,000. As set out in CP 31-103, s. 13.3, where you are not able to offer a client an investment option that is suitable and puts the client\u2019s interests first because the option is not available through your EMD, the regulators expect you to decline the client\u2019s account.

RISKY NATURE OF EXEMPT SECURITIES The risky nature of many exempt securities has the following implications: \u2022 These products are most suitable for an investor whose investment needs and objectives are growth or speculation", "ies has the following implications: \u2022 These products are most suitable for an investor whose investment needs and objectives are growth or speculation. \u2022 An investment in these products is most suitable for investors with a risk profile at the high end of the spectrum. \u2022 These products are subject to resale restrictions, there is no secondary market, and the lock-up periods could be indefinite in some cases. As such, these products are most suitable for investors with a long time horizon who are not seeking liquidity in the investment. \u2022 These products are appropriate only for investors who can afford the loss of their entire investment. Given the risk of total loss, you should ensure that an investment in these products represents only a small percentage of the investor\u2019s net worth. \u2022 Since many exempt products require a high minimum investment, they may only be appropriate for high-net- worth investors. \u2022 The investor should have sufficient investment knowledge to understand the product and its associated risks. CONCENTRATION Concentration is an integral element in the consideration of suitability", "t knowledge to understand the product and its associated risks. CONCENTRATION Concentration is an integral element in the consideration of suitability. It is considered high risk to have portfolios which hold assets that have high correlations to each other such as investment type, sector, asset class, geographic region, risk, etc. From the perspective of the exempt market, factors impacting correlation would include securities in the exempt market as a whole, securities of the same issuer, securities of a related issuer, etc. All would result in high correlation. These high correlations reduce diversification and increase risk from concentration. The securities regulators take the view that suitability should encompass not only the particular attributes of a security, viewed in isolation, but also the proposed quantum of the investment amount or the proposed trading strategy involving the security. As such, portfolios which are over-concentrated could pose suitability concerns. Under National Instrument (NI) 31-103, s", "tegy involving the security. As such, portfolios which are over-concentrated could pose suitability concerns.

Companion Policy (CP) 31-103, s", "urities within the account and the liquidity of those securities\u201d must be factored into any suitability determination. Companion Policy (CP) 31-103, s. 13.3 further explains the regulators\u2019 expectations with respect to concentration: \u201c\u2026registrants should assess whether the client\u2019s investments are over-concentrated in: \u2022 illiquid exempt market securities as compared to more liquid publicly traded securities, \u2022 securities of a single issuer, or group of related issuers, as compared to a broadly- based portfolio of issuers, or \u2022 securities of an issuer, or group of related issuers, that provides exposure to a single industry or asset class\u2026\u201d LESSON 5 SUITABILITY 12 \u2022 51 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE Given the fact that the securities regulators regard exempt securities as higher risk investments, portfolios with high weightings in exempt securities would be seen as having significant risk, particularly where they have high correlations to each other", "olios with high weightings in exempt securities would be seen as having significant risk, particularly where they have high correlations to each other. CSA Staff Notice 31-336 states: \u201c...staff will consider investments (either individually or taken together with prior investments) in securities of a single issuer or group of related issuers that represent more than 10% of the investor\u2019s net financial assets as potentially raising suitability concerns due to concentration.\u201d In deciding what percentage of a client\u2019s total portfolio (taking into account assets both inside and outside the EMD) is to be invested, you must consider: \u2022 the type of security \u2022 the asset class of the security \u2022 the sector of the security \u2022 the geographic region of the security \u2022 liquidity restrictions \u2022 the risk of the security \u2022 the client\u2019s portfolio as a whole including: \u2022 what portion of the client\u2019s portfolio is invested in the exempt market as a whole \u2022 what portion of the client\u2019s portfolio is invested in securities of the same issuer or related issuers You are expected to consider and document reasonable concentration thresholds to ensure that a client\u2019s investment does not exceed concentration thre", "You are expected to consider and document reasonable concentration thresholds to ensure that a client\u2019s investment does not exceed concentration thresholds which would result in the investment being unsuitable. The higher the concentration in exempt products, particularly those with high correlations to each other, the more steps you must take to demonstrate that the investment is suitable. You are also obligated to explain the concentration risk to the client and you should document your assessments and explanations as a best practice. Over-concentration in an investment, sector, geographic region, etc. can impact the risk and liquidity in a client\u2019s account.

TAX-ADVANTAGED INVESTMENTS Certain exempt securities, such as flow-through shares and flow-through limited partnerships, enjoy tax benefits which significantly enhance their potential return", "t securities, such as flow-through shares and flow-through limited partnerships, enjoy tax benefits which significantly enhance their potential return. The tax benefit is highest for investors who are subject to income tax at the top marginal rate. However, regardless of any tax benefits, investment products must be approached first and foremost as an investment. A decision to invest should be based primarily on an appraisal of the merits of the investment. The investor\u2019s risk profile is a critical factor, in particular their ability to absorb losses and in the case of flow-through shares, their willingness to invest in speculative junior resource companies. Volatility in the resource sector can be high and returns are unpredictable. As with any complex tax-driven investment, investors should consult with a qualified tax advisor to determine if the tax benefit is appropriate for them. While the tax advantages of a flow-through investment are important, they should not be an investor\u2019s only consideration", "efit is appropriate for them.

EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1212 \u2022 52 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE LEVERAGE SUITABILITY The suitability obligation extends beyond investment products and you are required to make a suitability determination to assess whether any investment strategy is suitable for a client. Under NI 31-103, s. 13.3(1), suitability must be assessed before you take any \u201cinvestment action\u201d for a client.

Alternative recommendations to address suitability issue(s) may include: \u2022 selling the unsuitable investment (where applicable/permitted) \u2022 not buying the unsuitable investment (in the case of a proposed transaction) \u2022 cancelling or reversing the trade in the unsuitable investment at no cost to the client \u2022 recommending other, off-setting trades or transactions in the account to bring the account \u201cin line\u201d with the client\u2019s KYC and objectives \u2022 reviewing and updating the client\u2019s KYC information, if appropriate (where the client\u2019s circumstances and/or objectives have changed) Making unsuitable recommendations or failing to address unsuitable outcomes may have severe consequences for you and for your firm, which may include: \u2022 client complaints against you and your EMD \u2022 internal investigation by your EMD \u2022 an external enforcement investigation by the securities regulator(s) LESSON 5 SUITABILITY 12 \u2022 53 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE When you are required to re-assess suitability under one of the suitability triggers (e.g", "LESSON 5 SUITABILITY 12 \u2022 53 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE When you are required to re-assess suitability under one of the suitability triggers (e.g. when a KYC review is triggered, when you become aware of a change in an investment, etc.), there may be limitations to the options to rectify what has become an unsuitable investment.

Client-directed trades must also be assessed for suitability", "are those which are initiated by the client without recommendation from you or your EMD. Client-directed trades must also be assessed for suitability.

Whether an EMD should accept or refuse such a trade is an internal policy decision and you will need to consult with your EMD. If your client proposes a trade or action that you believe is unsuitable, and you are unclear how to proceed after providing the required suitability determination and alternatives, then you should consult your EMD for guidance. You cannot actively promote or recommend a security and then rely on client-directed disclosure as proof that you did not recommend an investment", "nce. You cannot actively promote or recommend a security and then rely on client-directed disclosure as proof that you did not recommend an investment. The securities regulators take a dim view of situations where it appears that disclosure for client-directed trades is used as a means to evade suitability obligations and they have outlined their issues in this regard in CSA Staff Notice 31-336. With respect to the Offering Memorandum (OM) exemption, a number of provinces including Ontario require Dealing Representatives to make a positive suitability determination before they are permitted to make a recommendation to exceed the $30,000 investment threshold for eligible investors. As such, you cannot rely on a client-directed trade to permit a higher investment amount up to the $100,000 limit. The requirement to make a positive suitability determination forms part of the OM Exemption itself. DISCLOSURE It is important that you understand that disclosure does not justify an unsuitable recommendation", "on forms part of the OM Exemption itself. DISCLOSURE It is important that you understand that disclosure does not justify an unsuitable recommendation. For example, a recommendation to a client with a medium risk profile to purchase a high-risk investment is unsuitable, even if the client is provided with disclosure that shows the investment is high-risk. Thus, the fact that a client has been given a risk acknowledgement that fully discloses that an exempt investment is high-risk does not justify selling the security to a client with a medium risk profile. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1212 \u2022 54 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXAMPLE In June 2020, a Hearing Panel of the Alberta Securities Commission in Re Rustulka2 determined that a former Dealing Representative of an exempt market dealer had breached his KYC and suitability obligations", "Commission in Re Rustulka2 determined that a former Dealing Representative of an exempt market dealer had breached his KYC and suitability obligations. In its discussion and conclusion on the suitability obligation, the Hearing Panel noted that the obligation to complete the suitability assessment remains with the registrant: \u201c[228] \u2026we reiterate that a registrant\u2019s suitability obligation is not discharged just because a client has said that he or she knew of or accepted the risk of an investment, or because he or she has signed documents to that effect. We agree with the panel in Lamoureux that, \u201cno amount of disclosure to the investor, or acknowledgement by the investor, can convert an unsuitable investment into a suitable investment\u201d (at p. 28) or displace a registrant\u2019s obligation to conduct a proper suitability assessment (at p. 16).

LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this lesson, you will be able to: 1 | Provide an overview of the requirements for dealing with older and vulnerable clients 2 | Explain the requirements for establishing a Trusted Contact Person (TCP) 3 | Explain the requirements governing temporary holds 4 | Discuss the firm\u2019s policies and procedures for dealing with older and vulnerable clients DEALING WITH OLDER AND VULNERABLE CLIENTS Specific attention is required when dealing with investors who fall into the \u201csenior\u201d category, defined as individuals over the age of 65, and other vulnerable investors. Canadian securities regulators have established legislation and regulations with the purpose of protecting older and vulnerable clients. In general, older clients are thought to have limited ability to replenish capital losses through future income from other sources", "vulnerable clients. In general, older clients are thought to have limited ability to replenish capital losses through future income from other sources. As a broad rule, older clients typically have: \u2022 investment objectives that emphasize safety of capital and income rather than growth \u2022 lower risk profile than younger investors \u2022 shorter time horizons than younger investors It is also important to recognize that older clients may have unrealistic expectations for investment income. They need their investments to generate a certain level of income in order to maintain certain expenditure levels or avoid dependency on family members. However, stable, lower risk income products are generally not available in the exempt market. Figure 12.1 Notwithstanding the generalities concerning older clients, every individual is unique and the suitability process should accommodate the uniqueness of every client. However, the onus will be on you to demonstrate and evidence how and why an older client is an exception to the general rules. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1212 \u2022 58 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXAMPLE Luisa is your client", "ent is an exception to the general rules. EXEMPT MARKET PROFICIENCY COURSE UNIT 1212 \u2022 58 \u00a9 CANADIAN SECURITIES INSTITUTE EXAMPLE Luisa is your client. She is 70 years old and actively running her own real estate brokerage. She has a net worth of well over $2 million and an annual income in excess of $400,000. Luisa is a sophisticated investor who has invested in options in the past and has experience with short-selling. As her Dealing Representative, you feel confident that an exempt market security you are selling is suitable for her and you put Luisa\u2019s interests first when making your determination. You explain your reasons to Luisa and she agrees. You document your reasons and your conversation with Luisa. Vulnerable clients are defined as those individuals who might have an illness, impairment, disability, or aging- process limitation that places them at risk of financial exploitation. Financial exploitation is when a person or company uses, controls, or deprives the use or control of an individual\u2019s financial assets through undue influence, unlawful conduct, or another wrongful act", "uses, controls, or deprives the use or control of an individual\u2019s financial assets through undue influence, unlawful conduct, or another wrongful act. Extra caution should be exercised when dealing with older and vulnerable clients, especially if engaged in higher risk investments or strategies, or those that deplete capital through withdrawals that exceed returns. Generally speaking, leverage is not typically appropriate for older or vulnerable clients due to their lesser ability to withstand losses and their diminished ability to replenish capital. Other risks that have come to the forefront with respect to older and vulnerable clients are those involving reduced mental capacity. Older and vulnerable clients can be susceptible to physical or cognitive impairments which call into question their ability to properly understand the risks of investing in the exempt market and to instruct you in a meaningful way", "ents which call into question their ability to properly understand the risks of investing in the exempt market and to instruct you in a meaningful way.

Designating a TCP does not bestow any power to the TCP to make changes to the client\u2019s accounts or their financial dealings in any way. As such, the TCP should not be considered an alternative to a Power of Attorney (POA). You are required to take reasonable steps to maintain current records pertaining to the TCP and update those records within a reasonable time when there are significant changes made to the client\u2019s KYC information. You should follow your EMD\u2019s policies and procedures for designating TCPs, which might typically include procedures to ask clients to consider naming a TCP when: \u2022 the new account is opened \u2022 the KYC information is updated TEMPORARY HOLDS Under NI 31-103, s. 13.19, EMDs are permitted to place a temporary hold on a client\u2019s account should they reasonably believe that the client is a vulnerable client and is either at risk of being exploited financially or at risk because they do not have the mental capacity to make the financial decision related to an instruction for their account", "ploited financially or at risk because they do not have the mental capacity to make the financial decision related to an instruction for their account. By placing a temporary hold on an account, the EMD may temporarily disallow a: \u2022 withdrawal, liquidation, or transfer of cash or securities from an account \u2022 purchase or sale of a security Temporary holds can be applied at the transaction level, but not at the level of the entire account. A temporary hold must be limited to a specific transaction (e.g. a withdrawal, liquidation, transfer, etc.) and each transaction should be reviewed separately. Any transactions unrelated to the financial exploitation or lack of mental capacity should proceed free of hold.

Given that there is no \u201csafe harbour\u201d to protect registered firms from disputes should trading losses arise from unexecuted transactions, EMDs will need to consider the potential risks from trading losses. While safe harbours exist in other jurisdictions, such as the US, there is no such protection for registered firms in Canada. Therefore, EMDs will need to consider these risks when determining whether or not they will structure their programs to include temporary holds. RECOGNIZING COGNITIVE DECLINE AND FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION The regulators have provided good guidance on how Dealing Representatives can recognize cognitive decline and financial exploitation. In particular, Companion Policy (CP) 31-103, provides the CSA\u2019s definitions of financial exploitation and decline in mental capacity in Appendix G of the policy", "lar, Companion Policy (CP) 31-103, provides the CSA\u2019s definitions of financial exploitation and decline in mental capacity in Appendix G of the policy.
